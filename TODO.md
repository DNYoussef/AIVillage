ok so @/agents/sage/ is supposed to be the agent that manges the rag system and answers queries.

based on how the @/agents/king/ folder is structured and ist base agent file use that to help you make sage the agent for most rag tasks. other agents can ofcourse access it and make suggestions but it is their responibility primarily

look in the @/agent_forge/adas/ folder and you will find a file with a list of techniques like chain of thought. use those modules to build sage where possible

for the part about advanded nlp techniques. the information about document processing has parts of this already but it could be enhanced

exploration mode whould be amodule that all agents can particiapte in which means it need to be part of the rag system so different agents can plug into it

work this out step by step

Enhance agents/sage/ to manage the RAG system and answer queries:

Use the structure of agents/king/ as a reference to improve SageAgent.
