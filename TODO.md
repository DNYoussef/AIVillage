This detailed todo list provides a comprehensive breakdown of the tasks required to implement the AI Village system with frontier model integration and local model bootstrapping. Each main task is broken down into specific, actionable subtasks for clarity and ease of implementation.


To integrate OpenRouter into your programs and select appropriate models, follow these steps:

## Integration Process

1. **Create an Account**

Create an account on OpenRouter (www.openrouter.ai) and generate an API key[3].

2. **Choose Integration Method**

OpenRouter offers two main integration methods:

   a) **Direct API Integration**:

   Use the OpenRouter API endpoint directly in your code[3].

   b) **OpenAI SDK Compatibility**:

   Utilize OpenRouter through the OpenAI SDK by modifying the base URL[2].

3. **Set Up Authentication**

Include your OpenRouter API key in the request headers[3].

## Code Implementation

### Direct API Integration

```javascript

fetch("https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions", {

  method: "POST",

  headers: {

    "Authorization": `Bearer ${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}`,

    "HTTP-Referer": `${YOUR_SITE_URL}`, // Optional

    "X-Title": `${YOUR_SITE_NAME}`, // Optional

    "Content-Type": "application/json"

  },

  body: JSON.stringify({

    "model": "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo", // Replace with your chosen model

    "messages": [

      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"}

    ]

  })

});

```

### OpenAI SDK Compatibility

```javascript

import OpenAI from "openai"

const openai = new OpenAI({

  baseURL: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",

  apiKey: OPENROUTER_API_KEY,

  defaultHeaders: {

    "HTTP-Referer": YOUR_SITE_URL, // Optional

    "X-Title": YOUR_SITE_NAME // Optional

  }

})

async function main() {

  const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({

    model: "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo", // Replace with your chosen model

    messages: [

      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the meaning of life?"}

    ]

  })

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message)

}

main()

```

## Choosing a Model

To select an appropriate model for your use case:

1. **Browse Available Models**

Visit the OpenRouter models page (https://openrouter.ai/models) to explore available options[8].

2. **Consider Factors**

When choosing a model, consider:

   - Task requirements (e.g., general conversation, coding, roleplay)

   - Context length needed

   - Pricing

   - Supported parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p)

3. **Use Model Identifiers**

Replace the model identifier in your code with your chosen model. For example:

   - "openai/gpt-3.5-turbo"

   - "anthropic/claude-2.1"

   - "google/gemini-pro"

4. **Experiment with Settings**

Adjust model parameters to optimize performance. OpenRouter has analyzed optimal settings for various models, which you can use as a starting point[4].

5. **Utilize Auto-Routing (Optional)**

OpenRouter offers an "Auto" router that selects high-quality models based on your prompt. Use "model": "auto" in your request to enable this feature[5].

6. **Implement Fallbacks (Optional)**

Set up fallback models to handle errors or unavailability:

```javascript

{

  "models": ["anthropic/claude-2.1", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],

  "route": "fallback",

  // Other parameters

}

```

This configuration will try the first model and fall back to the second if needed[5].

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate OpenRouter into your programs and select the most suitable models for your specific requirements.
