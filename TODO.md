These implementations provide practical, usable implementations of the core ideas while:

1. Maintaining clarity and simplicity
2. Providing concrete functionality
3. Enabling easy testing and verification
4. Supporting extensibility
5. Considering human factors
6. Allowing for measurement and improvement

Key features of each implementation:

1. MultiPathExploration:
- Manages multiple solution paths
- Evaluates path promise
- Supports convergence detection
- Allows cross-pollination

2. ScaleAwareSolver:
- Handles multiple scales
- Tracks patterns across scales
- Maintains consistency
- Identifies reusable elements

3. PerspectiveShifter:
- Systematic domain shifting
- Assumption tracking
- Multiple viewpoint analysis
- Insight generation

4. ProgressiveRefinement:
- Balances exploration/exploitation
- Tracks promising directions
- Supports incremental improvement
- Maintains solution history

5. PatternIntegrator:
- Combines top-down and bottom-up analysis
- Validates pattern compatibility
- Supports evidence-based integration
- Tracks pattern relationships

6. ControlledDisruption:
- Manages disruption levels
- Tracks disruption patterns
- Generates insights from failures
- Maintains safety bounds

7. SolutionUnitManipulator:
- Handles decomposition and recombination
- Considers human factors
- Tracks unit effectiveness
- Supports intelligent recombination
