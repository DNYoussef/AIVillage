This table provides a quick reference for where each feature is implemented across the various files in the system. It can be helpful for understanding the structure of the AI village implementation and for locating specific functionalities when you need to work on or modify them.

Here's a consolidated version of the feature implementation:

1. Task Management: `unified_task_manager.py`
   - This file has the most comprehensive implementation, including creation, assignment, and completion of tasks.
   - Move task-specific logic from `workflow.py` here.
   - Keep the Task class definition in `task.py`, but move any management logic to `unified_task_manager.py`.

2. Workflow Management: `unified_task_manager.py`
   - Consolidate workflow management here, moving logic from `workflow.py`.
   - Keep the Workflow class definition in `workflow.py`, but move management logic to `unified_task_manager.py`.

3. Incentive Model: `incentive_model.py`
   - This file has the most complete implementation.
   - Move any incentive calculation logic from `unified_task_manager.py` to this file.

4. Agent Routing: `route_llm.py`
   - Consolidate all routing logic here.
   - Remove routing-related code from `unified_planning_and_management.py` and replace it with calls to `route_llm.py`.

5. Decision Making: `unified_decision_maker.py`
   - This file has a more comprehensive implementation including MCTS.
   - Move decision-making logic from `unified_planning_and_management.py` to this file.

6. Problem Analysis: `problem_analyzer.py`
   - Keep all problem analysis logic here.

7. Reasoning Engine: `reasoning_engine.py`
   - Maintain all reasoning logic in this file.

8. Plan Optimization: `optimization.py`
   - Consolidate all optimization logic here, including hyperparameter tuning.

9. Monte Carlo Tree Search: `mcts.py`
   - Move MCTS implementation from `unified_decision_maker.py` to this file.
   - Update `unified_decision_maker.py` to use MCTS from `mcts.py`.

10. Project Management: `unified_planning_and_management.py`
    - Consolidate project management here, moving relevant logic from `unified_task_manager.py`.

11. Performance Analysis: `incentive_model.py`
    - Move performance analysis logic from `unified_task_manager.py` to this file.

12. Model Saving/Loading: 
    - Implement a unified `model_persistence.py` file for all saving/loading operations.
    - Update other files to use this new module for persistence operations.

13. Batch and Parallel Processing: `unified_task_manager.py`
    - Consolidate batch processing here.
    - For parallel processing, create a new `parallel_processor.py` file and move relevant logic from `mcts.py` and `unified_decision_maker.py` there.

14. RAG System Integration, Quality Assurance, Eudaimonia Scoring, Rule Compliance Checking:
    - Create a new `ai_village_core.py` file to handle these cross-cutting concerns.
    - Update other files to use this core module for these functionalities.

15. Agent Communication: `unified_task_manager.py`
    - Centralize all agent communication logic here.

16. SEAL-Enhanced Planning: `problem_analyzer.py`
    - Keep this specialized planning logic here.
