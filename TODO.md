# Development TODOs

The previous feature table has been removed. All active work items are tracked on the GitHub issue tracker.

## Immediate Tasks

1. **Implement Quiet-STaR**: finish the thought-generation module and wire it into the training pipeline.
2. **Consolidate agent routing**: move all routing logic into `route_llm.py` and remove duplications.
3. **Add model persistence**: create `model_persistence.py` for unified save/load operations.
4. **Migrate workflow management**: centralize task workflows in `unified_task_manager.py`.
5. Review the remaining issues on GitHub for the full roadmap.
