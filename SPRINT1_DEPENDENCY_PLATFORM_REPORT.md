# Sprint 1: Dependency and Platform Verification Report

## Dependency Verification Results
- `src/communications/credit_manager.py` guards the `bittensor_wallet` import and raises a clear error with installation guidance when missing.
- The `anthropic` package is declared in `pyproject.toml` (`>=0.28.0`) and imports succeed after installation. Usage in `wave_bridge` modules is now wrapped in `try/except`.
- The `grokfast` git dependency referenced an invalid commit and repository without packaging. It has been removed from `pyproject.toml`; imports in training modules are now optional.

## Platform Compatibility Results
- Mobile `device_profiler` uses guarded imports for `jnius`, `Foundation`, and `objc`.
- Hard-coded log path in `earn_shells_worker.py` replaced with a user-specific directory.
- Windows-specific paths in `tools/scripts/execute_cleanup.py` replaced with dynamic path resolution.

## Test Results
- `pycycle --here` reported no circular imports.
- `pytest tests/test_grokfast_opt.py -q` passed using the new grokfast guard.
