# System Health Report

## Implementation Metrics
- Total functions scanned: 2432
- Estimated stub occurrences: 562
- Approximate implementation completion: 76.89%

## Working Components
- Twin runtime chat responds without requiring heavy dependencies
- Security gate now flags path traversal and other risky inputs

## Broken Components
- `make install` fails: missing dependency `grokfast>=0.1.0`
- Test suite cannot run due to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'AIVillage'`
- Comprehensive stub audit script `scripts/comprehensive_stub_audit.py` missing

## Critical Path Analysis
Basic workflows are blocked: package installation fails and tests do not execute because of import path errors. This prevents validation of system functionality.

## Deployment Blockers
1. Missing Python package `grokfast`
2. Misconfigured imports referencing package `AIVillage`
3. Absent stub audit tooling

## Next Steps
1. Resolve dependency and import issues
2. Restore or recreate stub audit script
3. Re-run full tests once environment stabilizes
