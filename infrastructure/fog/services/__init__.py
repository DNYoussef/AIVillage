"""
Fog Computing Services Package

Provides the orchestrated service architecture for fog computing including:
- Service-based architecture with event-driven communication
- Dependency injection and service discovery
- Health monitoring and metrics collection
- Backwards compatibility facade

This package replaces the monolithic FogCoordinator with a modular,
loosely-coupled service architecture while maintaining API compatibility.
