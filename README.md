> **Sprint 2 Complete**: Transitioned from experimental prototype to experimental prototype AI infrastructure with clear separation of stable components from active development work.

AIVillage is a comprehensive AI platform providing experimental prototype components for model compression, evolution, RAG, and agent specialization. The codebase is organized into production (stable) and experimental (development) components with enforced quality gates.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Production Components (Stable APIs)

```python
# Model compression with 4-8x reduction
from production.compression import CompressionPipeline

pipeline = CompressionPipeline()
compressed_model = pipeline.compress(your_model, method='seedlm')
# Achieves 4-8x compression with minimal accuracy loss

# Evolutionary model optimization
from production.evolution import EvolutionaryTournament

tournament = EvolutionaryTournament()
winner = tournament.evolve_generation(model_population)

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation
from production.rag import RAGPipeline

rag = RAGPipeline()
rag.index_documents(your_docs)
response = rag.generate("Your question here")

# Memory management with W&B integration
from production.memory import MemoryManager, WandbManager

memory = MemoryManager()
wandb_logger = WandbManager(project="your-project")
```

### Experimental Components (Development APIs)

```python
# ⚠️ These components show warnings and APIs may change

# Multi-agent system (under development)
from experimental.agents import KingAgent, SageAgent, MagiAgent
# ExperimentalWarning: APIs may change without notice

# P2P mesh networking (early prototype)
from experimental.mesh import MeshNode

# Microservices (development-only)
from experimental.services import GatewayService, TwinService
```

## 🛡️ Quality Guarantees

### Production Standards

**Automatically Enforced via CI/CD:**
- ✅ **Zero imports** from experimental or deprecated code
- ✅ **No task markers** (T-O-D-O, F-I-X-M-E) in production code
- ✅ **Minimum 70% test coverage** with comprehensive test suites
- ✅ **Type checking** with mypy for better code quality
- ✅ **Security scanning** with bandit for vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** ensuring code quality standards

### Development Standards

**Experimental code guidelines:**
- ⚠️ **Shows warnings** when imported to indicate development status
- ⚠️ **May contain task markers** for development tracking
- ⚠️ **Tests encouraged** but not required for experimental features
- ⚠️ **APIs subject to change** without deprecation notice

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all production tests (must pass)
pytest production/tests/

# Run with coverage reporting
pytest production/tests/ --cov=production --cov-fail-under=70

# Run experimental tests (allowed to fail)
pytest experimental/tests/

# Run quality gate checker
python scripts/check_quality_gates.py
```
