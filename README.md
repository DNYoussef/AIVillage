## What AIVillage Actually Is

AIVillage is a sophisticated multi-agent AI system with self-evolution capabilities. It currently offers a **prototype** core infrastructure for compression, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and agent orchestration. The project includes advanced mesh networking components and testing utilities, but production readiness and distributed inference still require significant validation.

## 🟢 What Actually Works (Verified Implementation)

### Core Infrastructure
- ✅ **Agent Templates**: ~18 specialized agent types with defined capabilities (validated by [scripts/validate_system.py](scripts/validate_system.py))
- ✅ **P2P Communication Framework**: Message protocol, encryption layer, and basic networking infrastructure (large-scale testing pending)
- ✅ **Resource Management**: Device profiling and constraint management system; performance under load is unverified
- ✅ **Evolution Framework**: Prototype KPI-based evolution engine with retirement and improvement strategies
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure**: Behavioral and integration tests available in [tests/](tests/)

### Development Infrastructure  
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflow with automated testing and quality checks
- ✅ **Code Quality Tools**: Pre-commit hooks, linting automation, and comprehensive analysis tools
- ✅ **Documentation**: API documentation structure and development guides
- ✅ **Monitoring**: MockMetric fallback system with real feedback and dashboard export

## 🟡 Partially Implemented (Needs Work)

### Core Functionality
- 🟡 **Agent Communication**: Protocol defined but end-to-end workflow needs validation
- 🟡 **Unified Compression System**: Consolidated from 28+ fragmented implementations into production-ready pipeline with 4x-100x+ compression ratios ([documentation](src/production/compression/README.md))
- 🟡 **RAG System**: Structure implemented; baseline latency ~1.19 ms/query with 100% accuracy ([results](docs/benchmarks/rag_latency_results.json))
- 🟡 **Evolution System**: Simulation logic complete but real agent evolution needs testing
- 🟡 **P2P Networking**: Basic implementation; localhost round-trip latency ~2.076 ms with 100% success rate ([results](docs/benchmarks/p2p_network_results.json))

## Known Issues

### Code Quality Issues
- 🔴 **Critical Issues**: 16 undefined variables and import errors fixed during analysis
- 🔴 **Linting Issues**: 7,932 style and quality issues identified (235 auto-fixed)
- 🔴 **Performance Claims**: Many benchmark claims need verification with real testing
- 🔴 **Error Handling**: Several try/catch blocks suppress errors without proper handling

### Implementation Gaps
- 🔴 **Token Economy**: Framework designed but not implemented
- 🔴 **DAO Governance**: Conceptual only, no implementation
- 🔴 **Production Deployment**: Development setup only, production deployment needs work
- 🔴 **Mobile Testing**: Mobile compatibility claimed but needs device validation

### TODO References
- TODO markers remain in benchmark scripts, e.g. GSM8K and MATH evaluations in [scripts/download_benchmarks.py](scripts/download_benchmarks.py)
- Evidence pack retrieval uses placeholder logic in [server.py](server.py)

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DNYoussef/AIVillage.git
   cd AIVillage
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies** (optional):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

### Usage

AIVillage provides a unified CLI interface:

```bash
# Agent creation and management
python main.py --mode agent-forge --action train --config config.yaml

# Run KING agent system
python main.py --mode king --action run --task "analyze data"

# Query RAG system
python main.py --mode rag --action query --question "What is AI?"

# Core utilities
python main.py --mode core --action status
```

### ⚠️ Important Usage Notes

- **Development vs Production**: `server.py` is for **DEVELOPMENT ONLY**
- **Production Deployment**: Use Gateway/Twin microservices (see [Production Guide](docs/deployment/PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md))
- **Testing**: Run `pytest` (not unittest as mentioned in some older docs)

## Compression Options

Two compression systems are available:

- **SimpleQuantizer** – fast 4x compression for models under ~100M parameters ([benchmark results](docs/benchmarks/compression_results.json))
- **Advanced Pipeline** – four-stage 100x+ compression for large models
- **UnifiedCompressor** – automatically chooses between the two with fallback

See [docs/COMPRESSION_EVOLUTION.md](docs/COMPRESSION_EVOLUTION.md) for details.

```bash
bandit --ini .bandit -r src
```

## Performance Benchmarking & Stress Testing

Run all sprint benchmarks and aggregate their metrics:

```

Both utilities emit JSON reports for reproducible performance analysis.
