## Integration Status
- Pipeline class exists: Yes (`src/core/compression/advanced_pipeline.py`)
- Components connected: Yes
- Tests available: Yes (`tests/test_advanced_compression.py`)

## Next Steps
1. Replace stub compressors with real implementations.
2. Wire up data flow between stages.
3. Evaluate on real models.
4. Optimize for mobile deployment.
