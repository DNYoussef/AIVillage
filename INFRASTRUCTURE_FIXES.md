# Development Infrastructure Fixes

## Summary
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to use flexible `python3` interpreter, added `default_language_version`, and included standard hooks such as `flake8`.
- Relaxed Python requirement in `pyproject.toml` to `>=3.8` and aligned tool configurations.
- Added `.flake8` and `.isort.cfg` for consistent linting.
- Replaced `Makefile` with a universal template exposing common targets.
- Created root `requirements-dev.txt` and `requirements-test.txt` for development and testing dependencies.
- Added helper scripts in `scripts/` and top-level `validate_infrastructure.sh`.
- Generated `INFRASTRUCTURE_STATUS.md` to document current infrastructure state.

## Usage
1. Run `scripts/setup.sh` to install dependencies.
2. Use `make lint` and `make test` for checks.
3. `scripts/ci_test.sh` mirrors CI pipeline locally.
4. Execute `validate_infrastructure.sh` to verify tooling.

## Troubleshooting
- If hooks fail due to formatting, run `make format` to auto-format.
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed and accessible as `python3`.
- Install missing tools with `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.
