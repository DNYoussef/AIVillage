# Scripts Directory

Entry point scripts and utilities moved from root directory during cleanup.

## Files Moved Here

### From Root
- `memory_constrained_evolution.py` - Historic evolution runner with memory constraints

## Usage

All scripts in this directory are designed to be run from the project root:

```bash
# From AIVillage root
python scripts/memory_constrained_evolution.py
```

## Purpose

This directory contains executable scripts that were cluttering the root directory. Each script maintains its original functionality but is now properly organized.
