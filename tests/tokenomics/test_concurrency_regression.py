"""
Tokenomics DB Concurrency Regression Guard - Prompt 8

Tests for concurrent access patterns that could cause race conditions,
deadlocks, or data corruption in the credit system. This serves as a
regression guard to ensure changes don't break concurrent operation.

Key scenarios tested:
- Multiple threads doing simultaneous balance updates
- Concurrent transaction recording
- High-frequency earning/spending operations
- Database lock handling under load
- WAL mode effectiveness under concurrent access
