                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines 
                capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI systems can learn, reason, 
                perceive, and make decisions. The field includes several key areas:
                
                Machine Learning: A subset of AI where systems automatically improve through experience without being 
                explicitly programmed. Popular algorithms include neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines.
                
                Deep Learning: Uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns 
                in data. It has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
                
                Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. 
                Applications include chatbots, translation systems, and sentiment analysis.
                
                Computer Vision: Allows machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world. 
                Used in autonomous vehicles, medical imaging, and facial recognition systems.
                
                AI has applications across industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.

                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate 
                variations are natural, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the main driver of 
                climate change since the mid-20th century.
                
                Primary Causes:
                - Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) releases greenhouse gases
                - Deforestation reduces CO2 absorption
                - Industrial processes and agriculture contribute methane and other gases
                
                Key Effects:
                - Global average temperatures have risen by about 1.1Â°C since pre-industrial times
                - Sea levels are rising due to thermal expansion and melting ice sheets
                - More frequent extreme weather events (hurricanes, droughts, heatwaves)
                - Changes in precipitation patterns affecting agriculture and water supply
                - Ocean acidification due to increased CO2 absorption
                
                Solutions include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, 
                protecting forests, and developing carbon capture technologies.

                Quantum computing is a revolutionary computing paradigm that harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena 
                like superposition and entanglement to process information in fundamentally different ways than 
                classical computers.
                
                Key Principles:
                - Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superposition, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously
                - Quantum entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in ways that classical bits cannot
                - Quantum interference enables quantum algorithms to amplify correct answers and cancel wrong ones
                
                Advantages:
                - Potential exponential speedup for certain problems
                - Could break current encryption methods (Shor's algorithm)
                - Simulate complex quantum systems for drug discovery and materials science
                
                Current Challenges:
                - Quantum states are fragile and easily disrupted by environmental noise
                - Error rates are still high compared to classical computers  
                - Limited number of qubits in current systems
                - Requires extremely cold temperatures (near absolute zero)
                
                Companies like IBM, Google, and Microsoft are developing quantum computers, with applications 
                expected in cryptography, optimization, and scientific simulation.

                Renewable energy comes from natural sources that are constantly replenished, offering sustainable 
                alternatives to fossil fuels for electricity generation and heating.
                
                Major Types:
                
                Solar Energy:
                - Photovoltaic (PV) panels convert sunlight directly to electricity
                - Solar thermal systems use sun's heat for hot water and space heating
                - Costs have dropped dramatically, now competitive with fossil fuels in many regions
                
                Wind Energy:
                - Wind turbines convert kinetic energy of wind into electricity
                - Offshore wind farms can access stronger, more consistent winds
                - Fastest growing renewable energy source globally
                
                Hydroelectric Power:
                - Uses flowing water to generate electricity through turbines
                - Provides about 16% of global electricity generation
                - Can provide grid stability and energy storage through pumped hydro
                
                Geothermal Energy:
                - Harnesses heat from Earth's interior for electricity and heating
                - Provides consistent, baseload power unlike variable solar and wind
                - Limited to regions with accessible geothermal resources
                
                Benefits include reduced greenhouse gas emissions, energy independence, 
                job creation, and increasingly competitive costs.
