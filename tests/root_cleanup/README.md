# Root Cleanup Tests

Test files moved from root directory during core cleanup.

## Files Moved Here

### From Root
- `test_dashboard.py` - Agent Forge test dashboard
- `test_real_fixes.py` - Implementation fix verification tests

## Purpose

These are test files that were in the root directory, moved here for better organization. They test core functionality and fixes implemented during development.

## Running Tests

```bash
# From AIVillage root
python tests/root_cleanup/test_dashboard.py
python tests/root_cleanup/test_real_fixes.py
```

Note: These may require specific dependencies or setup to run successfully.
