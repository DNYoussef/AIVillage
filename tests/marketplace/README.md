# Unified Federated Marketplace Integration Tests

## Overview

This comprehensive test suite validates that the unified federated AI marketplace works seamlessly for users of all sizes, from small startups to enterprise customers. The tests ensure that both inference and training workloads are supported across different user tiers with appropriate marketplace integration.

## Test Coverage

### 🔧 Core Components Tested

1. **Unified Federated Coordinator** (`test_unified_federated_marketplace.py`)
   - Single system handles both inference and training workloads
   - Seamless switching between workload types
   - Shared resource pools and participant management
   - Unified API interface functionality

2. **Size-Tier Marketplace Integration** (`test_user_tier_scenarios.py`)
   - **Small Users**: Mobile devices, low-cost inference/training
   - **Medium Users**: Hybrid fog/cloud resources, balanced performance
   - **Large Users**: Cloud clusters, high-performance workloads  
   - **Enterprise Users**: Dedicated resources, SLA guarantees, priority access

3. **Performance Benchmarks & SLA Validation** (`test_performance_benchmarks.py`)

   - Multi-workload billing aggregation

## Test Scenarios Validated

### 🎯 Critical Success Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Small User - Mobile Inference
```python
user_request = {
    "user_tier": "small",
    "workload": "inference", 
    "model": "mobile-bert",
    "max_budget": 5.00,
    "priority": "cost"
}
# ✅ Gets mobile devices, stays under budget, reasonable performance
```

#### Scenario 2: Enterprise - Large-Scale Training  
```python
user_request = {
    "user_tier": "enterprise",
    "workload": "training",
    "model": "gpt-large", 
    "participants": 500,
    "sla_required": True,
    "max_budget": 5000.00
}
# ✅ Gets dedicated resources, meets SLA, priority access
```

#### Scenario 3: Mixed Workload User
```python
morning_inference = {"workload": "inference", "model": "bert", "budget": 20}
afternoon_training = {"workload": "training", "model": "bert", "participants": 25, "budget": 100}
# ✅ Seamless switching, shared resources, integrated billing
```

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-asyncio torch

# Ensure project structure is correct
cd /path/to/AIVillage
```

# Run user tier scenario tests
pytest tests/marketplace/test_user_tier_scenarios.py -v

# Run performance benchmark tests  
pytest tests/marketplace/test_performance_benchmarks.py -v

# Run billing integration tests
pytest tests/marketplace/test_budget_billing_integration.py -v
```

### Comprehensive Test Runner

```bash
# Run complete test suite with detailed reporting
python tests/marketplace/test_runner_comprehensive.py
```

This will generate:
- Real-time console output with progress
- Detailed JSON report (`comprehensive_marketplace_test_report.json`)
- Success/failure analysis for each user tier
- Performance benchmarks and SLA compliance validation

## Test Architecture

### UnifiedFederatedCoordinator Class

The core of the test system is the `UnifiedFederatedCoordinator` which simulates:

- **Fog Marketplace**: Dynamic pricing, resource bidding, SLA management
- **Gateway Marketplace**: Resource allocation, bid matching, pricing tiers  
- **Inference Coordinator**: Distributed AI inference across heterogeneous networks
- **User Tier Management**: Different privilege levels and resource limits

### Key Features Tested

1. **Marketplace Integration**
   - Dynamic pricing based on supply/demand
   - Multi-region fog zones for redundancy
   - SLA enforcement with penalties
   - Trust-based matching algorithms

2. **Federated Inference**  
   - Intelligent load balancing and request routing
   - Model distribution and caching strategies
   - Privacy-preserving inference protocols
   - Integration with P2P and fog infrastructure

3. **User Tier Management**
   - Budget limits and enforcement by tier
   - Priority access and SLA guarantees
   - Resource allocation preferences
   - Cost optimization strategies
