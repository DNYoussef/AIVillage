"""Lightweight registry for tracking agent locations.

This module provides a minimal implementation to support tests
involving distributed agents. It tracks which device currently hosts
an agent instance and exposes simple async helpers for updating
locations. The real production system would likely back this registry
with a database or distributed key-value store. For the purposes of the
unit tests we keep everything in memory and focus on race-free
operations using :class:`asyncio.Lock`.
