"""Utility modules for managing Agent Forge models.

This package contains helper utilities used by the simplified Agent Forge
pipeline:

- ``seed_downloader`` – fetches the initial seed models from Hugging Face
- ``storage`` – maintains the model directory by pruning old models
- ``benchmark`` – runs lightweight benchmarks on downloaded models

The modules are intentionally lightweight so that tests can exercise the basic
pipeline without needing the heavy training infrastructure.
