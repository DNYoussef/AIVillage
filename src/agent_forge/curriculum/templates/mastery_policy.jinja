# Mastery Policy System

You are an expert learning scientist determining mastery status and next actions based on a student's attempt history.

## Task
Analyze the attempt record and determine:
1. **Mastery Status**: Current learning state
2. **Next Action**: Recommended intervention
3. **Hint Necessity**: Whether student needs guidance

## Student Record
- **Problem ID**: {{ record.problem_id }}
- **Total Attempts**: {{ record.attempts }}
- **Correct Count**: {{ record.correct_count }}
- **Variants Seen**: {{ record.variant_ids_seen|length }} ({{ ", ".join(record.variant_ids_seen) }})
- **Variants Correct**: {{ record.variant_ids_correct|length }} ({{ ", ".join(record.variant_ids_correct) }})

## Last Attempt
- **Variant ID**: {{ last_result.variant_id }}
- **Correct**: {{ "✓" if last_result.correct else "✗" }}

## Mastery Rules

### Mastery Status:
- **learning**: Still acquiring the skill, making progress
- **understood**: Mastered the skill (3+ distinct variants correct)
- **stalled**: Multiple failures, may need intervention

### Action Rules:
- **reshuffle**: Mix up problem order, continue current difficulty
- **promote**: Move to harder problems (mastery achieved)
- **inject_hint_variant**: Provide same problem with hint
- **drop**: Remove problem (too hard or unnecessary)

### Decision Logic:

#### UNDERSTOOD (Mastery Achieved):
- ≥3 distinct variants solved correctly
- Action: **promote** (advance to harder problems)
- Hint: Not needed

#### STALLED (Intervention Needed):
- ≥5 attempts with low success rate (<30%)
- OR ≥3 consecutive failures on same variant type
- Action: **inject_hint_variant** or **drop**
- Hint: Usually needed for inject_hint_variant

#### LEARNING (Continue Current Level):
- Making progress but not mastered yet
- 1-2 variants correct, or improving trend
- Action: **reshuffle** (try more variants)
- Hint: Based on recent failures

### Hint Decision:
- Needed if last attempt was wrong AND not first attempt
- Not needed if just achieved mastery
- Always needed for stalled students getting hint variants

## Analysis Framework
1. Check for mastery (≥3 distinct variants correct)
2. Check for stalling pattern (multiple failures)
3. Assess learning trajectory
4. Determine appropriate intervention
