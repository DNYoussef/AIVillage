## Usage Examples

### Basic Memory Operations
```python
coordinator = MCPServerCoordinator()

# Store knowledge
await coordinator.store_memory("api_design", design_data, "project/architecture")

# Retrieve context
context = await coordinator.retrieve_memory("api_design", "project/architecture")

# Search patterns
patterns = await coordinator.search_memory("api_", "project/architecture")
```

### Agent Coordination
```python
enhanced_coordinator = EnhancedAgentCoordinator("AIVillage")

# Initialize session
session = await enhanced_coordinator.initialize_session("dev_001", config)

# Spawn coordinated agents
agents_config = [
    {"type": "researcher", "task": "...", "context_keys": ["..."]},
    {"type": "coder", "task": "...", "servers": ["github", "memory"]}
]
result = await enhanced_coordinator.spawn_coordinated_agents("dev_001", agents_config)
```

### Project Context Management
```python
project_context = ProjectContextManager(coordinator, "AIVillage")

# Store architectural decision
await project_context.store_architecture_decision("mcp_integration", {
    "decision": "Use Memory MCP as coordination hub",
    "rationale": "Enables persistent learning"
})

# Get full project context
context = await project_context.get_project_context()
```

## Best Practices for Multi-Agent Coordination

### 1. Memory Integration
- Always use Memory MCP as central coordination hub
- Store agent assignments in coordination namespace
- Use memory for inter-agent communication
- Persist intermediate results for handoffs

### 2. Server Selection
- Match server capabilities to agent roles
- Consider performance requirements and rate limits
- Plan for concurrent usage patterns
- Design fallback strategies for server failures

### 3. Workflow Design
- Use MCP for coordination, Claude Code for execution
- Implement parallel server usage when possible
- Design clear data flow between MCP servers
- Monitor and track performance metrics

## Integration with Claude Code

The system follows the established pattern:
- **MCP coordinates** - Sets up topology and manages knowledge
- **Claude Code executes** - Spawns actual agents and performs work
- **Memory persists** - Maintains context across sessions

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics** - Real-time performance monitoring
2. **Intelligent Caching** - Predictive prefetching of relevant context
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Merge strategies for concurrent updates
4. **Security Enhancements** - End-to-end encryption, access controls
5. **Cross-Project Learning** - Knowledge sharing between projects

## System Status

Status: **FULLY OPERATIONAL**
- Memory coordination system: Active
- Knowledge base: Populated with 9 MCP servers
- Integration patterns: 5 documented workflows
- Best practices: Comprehensive guidelines stored
- Performance analytics: Real-time monitoring enabled

The Memory Coordination Specialist Agent is now ready to support advanced multi-agent workflows with persistent learning and intelligent server coordination.
