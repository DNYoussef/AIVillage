```

#### Security Recommendations:
1. **Immediate**: Install `pip-audit` for continuous vulnerability scanning
2. **Weekly**: Run `safety check` on production dependencies
3. **Monthly**: Review security advisories for all packages
4. **Critical**: Set up automated security updates for CVE patches

### 4. Performance Impact Analysis

#### Heavy Dependencies (>100MB each):
- **torch + torchvision + torchaudio**: ~3.5GB (CUDA support)
- **transformers + datasets**: ~800MB (model weights)
- **bitsandbytes**: ~200MB (quantization library)
- **accelerate**: ~150MB (training acceleration)

#### Performance Recommendations:
1. **Production**: Use CPU-only torch (`torch==2.4.0+cpu`) for 70% size reduction
2. **Edge Deployment**: Consider model quantization with bitsandbytes
3. **Docker**: Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size
4. **CI/CD**: Cache heavy dependencies to reduce build time

### 5. Python Version Compatibility

#### Current Status: ✅ Python 3.10+ Compatible
- **Fully Compatible**: Core web framework, databases, utilities
- **Limited Support**: Some ML packages have Python 3.12 restrictions
- **Windows Issues**: bitsandbytes has known Windows/newer Python issues

#### Compatibility Matrix:
```
Python 3.10: ✅ Full Support
Python 3.11: ✅ Full Support  
Python 3.12: ⚠️  Limited (some ML packages)
Python 3.13: ❌ Not yet supported
```

### 6. MCP Server Dependencies

#### Current MCP Stack:
- **websockets**: 12.0 (protocol communication)
- **pydantic**: 2.8.2 (message validation)
- **PyJWT**: 2.9.0 (authentication)
- **cryptography**: 43.0.1 (security)

#### MCP Compatibility: ✅ All dependencies compatible with MCP protocol v1.0

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1)
1. **Resolve Critical Conflicts**: Update torch, transformers, fastapi to latest
2. **Security Update**: Apply all security patches
3. **Consolidate Files**: Merge overlapping requirements files

### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 2-3)
1. **Performance**: Implement production/development split
2. **Testing**: Update all test dependencies to compatible versions
3. **Documentation**: Add dependency management documentation

### Phase 3: Maintenance (Ongoing)
1. **Monitoring**: Set up automated vulnerability scanning
2. **Updates**: Monthly dependency review and update cycle
3. **Cleanup**: Remove unused dependencies quarterly

        run: |
          pip install pip-audit safety
          pip-audit --requirement requirements/production.txt
          safety check --requirement requirements/production.txt
