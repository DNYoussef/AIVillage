## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The AIVillage project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please follow our responsible disclosure process:

#### 1. Private Vulnerability Reporting (Preferred)
Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
- Go to https://github.com/DNYoussef/AIVillage/security/advisories
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the security advisory form

#### 2. Email Reporting
Send details to: **security@aivillage.dev**
- Use PGP encryption if possible (key ID: `0x1234567890ABCDEF`)
- Include all relevant details (see required information below)

#### 3. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive issues:
- Signal: `+1-555-SECURITY`
