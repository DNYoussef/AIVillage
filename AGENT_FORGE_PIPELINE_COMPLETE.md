```
Seed Models (3) â†’ Model Manager (D: drive) â†’ EvoMerge Evolution â†’
Multi-Model Curriculum â†’ Hybrid Training â†’ Compression â†’ Production
```

### **Key Components Delivered:**

  - `microsoft/phi-1_5` (1.3B params, efficient Python coding)
- **Benchmarking**: Automated performance evaluation with W&B integration
- **Generation Tracking**: Complete lineage tracking for evolved models

#### **2. EvoMerge Evolution System**
- **Multi-Generation Evolution**: Creates offspring through model merging
- **Performance-Based Selection**: Selects best performers as parents
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes old generations to maintain 8-model limit
- **Genetic Diversity**: Tracks parent lineage and evolution history

#### **3. Multi-Model Curriculum Engine** (Enhanced as Requested)
- **Model Pool Integration**: Alternates randomly between 3 top AI models:
  - **OpenAI GPT-4o** (closest to GPT-5 available)
  - **Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (closest to Claude Opus 4.1)
  - **Google Gemini Pro 1.5** (closest to Gemini 2.5 Pro)
- **Random Model Selection**: Each curriculum operation uses different models
- **Diversity Benefits**: Different AI perspectives for questions, grading, hints
- **Model Statistics**: Tracks usage and diversity scores

#### **4. Production Infrastructure**
- **W&B Integration**: Complete experiment tracking and benchmarking
- **CLI Interface**: Full command-line tools for pipeline management
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time metrics and alerting
- **Storage Management**: Intelligent cleanup and space optimization

## ðŸ§¬ EvoMerge Process Implementation

### **Evolutionary Pipeline:**
1. **Seed Phase**: Download 3 base models to D: drive
2. **Generation 1**: Create offspring through model merging
3. **Selection**: Choose best performers based on benchmarks
4. **Evolution**: Repeat for configurable generations
5. **Best Model Selection**: Return top 3 evolved models

### **Key Features:**
- **Automated Benchmarking**: Each model tested on inference tasks
- **Performance Tracking**: Complete W&B integration for metrics
- **Space Management**: Old generations deleted to maintain 8-model limit
- **Lineage Tracking**: Full parent-child relationship tracking

## ðŸŽ“ Multi-Model Curriculum Integration

### **Enhanced OpenRouter Client** (As Requested):
```python
# Multi-model pool alternates randomly between top AI models
model_pool = [
    "openai/gpt-4o",                      # GPT-5 equivalent
    "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022", # Claude Opus 4.1 equivalent
    "google/gemini-pro-1.5"               # Gemini 2.5 Pro equivalent
]
```

### **Random Model Selection Benefits:**
- **Diverse Problem Generation**: Each AI brings different creative approaches
- **Robust Grading**: Multiple AI perspectives reduce grading bias
- **Varied Hint Strategies**: Different learning approaches from each model
- **Consensus-Based Edge Control**: Better edge-of-chaos maintenance
- **Reduced Overfitting**: No single model dependency
