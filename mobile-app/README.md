# Mobile Demo

This folder contains a small React Native app used to demonstrate the Twin runtime on mobile devices. The code provides a basic tab navigator and simple screens with internationalisation via `i18next`.

## Running

Install dependencies and launch the Expo development server:

```bash
npm install
yarn start  # or `npx expo start`
```

The app is intentionally minimal and serves as a proof of concept for future mobile integrations.
