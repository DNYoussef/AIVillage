# AIVillage: Experimental AI Infrastructure

[![API Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-latest-blue)](docs/) [![Coverage](docs/assets/coverage.svg)](#) [![Quality Gates](https://img.shields.io/badge/quality-gates-passing-green)](#quality-gates)

> **Development Status**: Active development with production-ready compression, evolution, and RAG components alongside experimental agent and mesh networking systems.

AIVillage is an experimental AI platform providing components for model compression, evolution, RAG, and agent specialization. The codebase separates production-ready components from experimental development work.

## ⚠️ Development Server Notice

**`server.py` is DEVELOPMENT ONLY** - Use Gateway/Twin services for production:
- `server.py`: Development and testing only (not production-ready)
- Production: Use `experimental/services/gateway.py` and `experimental/services/twin.py`
- See `docs/architecture.md` for production deployment guidance

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Production Components (Stable APIs)

```python
# Model compression with 4-8x reduction
from production.compression import CompressionPipeline

pipeline = CompressionPipeline()
compressed_model = pipeline.compress(your_model, method='seedlm')
# Achieves 4-8x compression with minimal accuracy loss

# Evolutionary model optimization
from production.evolution import EvolutionaryTournament

tournament = EvolutionaryTournament()
winner = tournament.evolve_generation(model_population)

# Retrieval-Augmented Generation
from production.rag import RAGPipeline

rag = RAGPipeline()
rag.index_documents(your_docs)
response = rag.generate("Your question here")

# Memory management with W&B integration
from production.memory import MemoryManager, WandbManager

memory = MemoryManager()
wandb_logger = WandbManager(project="your-project")
```

### Experimental Components (Development APIs)

```python
# ⚠️ These components show warnings and APIs may change

# Multi-agent system (under development)
from experimental.agents import KingAgent, SageAgent, MagiAgent
# ExperimentalWarning: APIs may change without notice

# P2P mesh networking (early prototype)
from experimental.mesh import MeshNode

# Microservices (development-only)
from experimental.services import GatewayService, TwinService
```

## 🛡️ Quality Guarantees

### Production Standards

**Automatically Enforced via CI/CD:**
- ✅ **Zero imports** from experimental or deprecated code
- ✅ **No task markers** (T-O-D-O, F-I-X-M-E) in production code
- ✅ **Minimum 70% test coverage** with comprehensive test suites
- ✅ **Type checking** with mypy for better code quality
- ✅ **Security scanning** with bandit for vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** ensuring code quality standards

### Development Standards

**Experimental code guidelines:**
- ⚠️ **Shows warnings** when imported to indicate development status
- ⚠️ **May contain task markers** for development tracking
- ⚠️ **Tests encouraged** but not required for experimental features
- ⚠️ **APIs subject to change** without deprecation notice

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all production tests (must pass)
pytest production/tests/

# Run with coverage reporting  
pytest production/tests/ --cov=production --cov-fail-under=70

# Run experimental tests (allowed to fail)
pytest experimental/tests/

# Run quality gate checker
python scripts/check_quality_gates.py
```
