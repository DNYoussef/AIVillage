- Target: 52% reduction (13.8GB → 6.6GB)

### 3. System Complexity Analysis

**Scale**: 81,789 Python files across the system

**Impact on Performance**:
- Build times: 15-20 minutes (target: <7 minutes)
- Maintenance overhead: Excessive
- Code complexity: High cognitive load
- Testing complexity: Extensive coordination required

### 4. Production Systems Status

| System | Status | Completion | Performance |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| Compression | Production | 95% | Good (6.5x compression) |
| Evolution | Production | 90% | Good (5 gen/min) |
| RAG | Production | 85% | Acceptable (1.8s queries) |
| Mesh Network | Fixed | 50% | Improved but needs work |
