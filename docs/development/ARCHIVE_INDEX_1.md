# Documentation Archive Index

*Archive created during Sprint 2 documentation cleanup - July 27, 2025*

This archive contains outdated documents that were removed from the root directory to reduce confusion and align documentation with the actual project status.

## Misleading Claims (`misleading_claims/`)

These documents contained promotional language and premature success claims that contradicted the actual codebase analysis:

- **AI_VILLAGE_EXPANSION_PLAN.md** - Claimed Magi agent was "ready for deployment" despite being experimental
- **HISTORIC_MAGI_AGENT_SUCCESS.md** - Fabricated "historic success" narrative inconsistent with audit findings
- **HISTORIC_MAGI_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Premature deployment documentation for experimental features
- **HISTORIC_ACHIEVEMENT_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Over-inflated achievement claims
- **MAGI_SUCCESS_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Additional promotional content contradicting reality

**Reason for archival**: These documents had a trust-damaging effect (contributing to the 42% trust score identified in analysis) by making claims not supported by the implementation.

## Temporary Reports (`temporary_reports/`)

These were one-time reports and logs that served their purpose but are no longer needed for ongoing development:

- **GITHUB_SYNC_SUMMARY.md** - One-time sync operation logs
- **GITHUB_SYNC_COMPLETE.md** - Temporary sync completion notification
- **COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_REPORT.md** - Snapshot during reorganization process
- **REORGANIZATION_REPORT.md** - Temporary file reorganization documentation
- **core_cleanup_report.md** - Single-use cleanup completion report
- **circular_dependencies_report.md** - Post-cleanup validation report
- **stub_audit_report.md** - 13,000+ stub function listing (no longer relevant after reorganization)

**Reason for archival**: These served their purpose during specific cleanup phases but became clutter for ongoing development.

## Pre-Sprint 2 Analysis (`pre_sprint2_analysis/`)

These comprehensive analysis documents identified critical issues that Sprint 2 successfully addressed:

- **COMPREHENSIVE_CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md** - Full audit identifying organizational and trust issues
- **DOCUMENTATION_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed plan for fixing misleading documentation
- **EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY_AIVILLAGE_ANALYSIS.md** - Summary concluding project was "misleading" with 42% trust score

**Reason for archival**: These documents served their purpose in identifying problems. Their findings are now incorporated into the Sprint 2 completion report, and the issues they identified have been resolved.

## Current Status

The root directory now contains only relevant, accurate documentation:

- **README.md** - Honest, realistic project description
- **SPRINT2_COMPLETION_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive status after addressing all identified issues
- **SPRINT2_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Guide for transitioning to production/experimental structure
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history

## Trust and Reliability

By removing misleading promotional content and consolidating redundant analysis documents, the project now presents a clear, honest picture of its capabilities and status. This cleanup was essential for building genuine trust and enabling productive development going forward.
