# GitHub Workflow Failure Analysis Report - CORRECTED

**Generated**: 2025-09-01  
**Analysis Scope**: AIVillage CI/CD Pipeline Failures  
**Agent**: GitHub MCP Analysis Agent  
**Repository**: AIVillage  

---

## Executive Summary - CORRECTED ANALYSIS

After detailed examination of logs and dependency analysis, the AIVillage repository CI/CD failures have been **MISDIAGNOSED**. The actual root causes are different from initial assessment.

### CORRECTED Critical Issues Identified:

1. **Test Environment Import Chain Failures** (CRITICAL)
2. **Mock System Integration Problems** (BLOCKING) 
3. **Path Resolution Issues in Workflows** (HIGH)
4. **GitHub CLI Missing in CI Environment** (MEDIUM)
5. **MCP Server Network/Authentication Issues** (MEDIUM)

---

## CORRECTED Dependency Analysis

### Dependencies Status - ACTUALLY WORKING:

| Package | Required Version | Installed Version | Status |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|--------|
| numpy | Any stable | 1.26.4 | âœ… WORKING |
| pytest-asyncio | Any | 1.1.0 | âœ… WORKING |
| torch | >=2.1.0 | 2.2.1 | âœ… WORKING |
| pytest-* plugins | Various | All present | âœ… WORKING |

### Real Issue Analysis:

**The logs show that NumPy 2.x error is actually from a local Windows environment**, not the CI/CD pipeline. The CI/CD failures are due to:

1. **Mock System Failure**: `from tests.mocks import install_mocks` creates circular import dependencies
2. **Path Issues**: Dynamic imports in mock system failing  
3. **Environment**: CI environment differs from local development environment

---

## CORRECTED Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Test Mock System Issues

**Primary Problem**: The mock installation system in `tests/mocks/__init__.py` is attempting to import modules that may not exist or have circular dependencies:

```python
# Line 51 in tests/mocks/__init__.py
importlib.import_module("agent_forge.memory_manager")
```

This cascades through:
- `src/agent_forge/__init__.py` line 7: `from .training import (`
- `src/agent_forge/training/forge_train.py` line 20: `import torch`
- Torch initialization can fail in different environments

### 2. GitHub CLI Missing in CI Environment

The workflow analysis attempted to use `gh` command which is not installed in the current CI environment:
```bash
/usr/bin/bash: line 1: gh: command not found
```

### 3. MCP Server Installation Issues

The workflows attempt to install claude-flow but there are network/authentication issues:
```bash
npx claude-flow@alpha mcp start --auto-orchestrator --enable-neural --daemon
```

This suggests either:
- Package not available  
- Authentication required
- Network connectivity issues in CI

## CORRECTED Priority-Ranked Fix Recommendations

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)

#### 1. Fix Test Mock System
```python
# In tests/mocks/__init__.py - add error handling
def install_mocks():
    modules_to_mock = [
        "agent_forge.memory_manager",
        # ... other modules
    ]
    
    for module_name in modules_to_mock:
        try:
            importlib.import_module(module_name)
        except ImportError as e:
            # Create mock module instead of failing
            create_mock_module(module_name)
            logger.warning(f"Mocked module {module_name} due to import error: {e}")
```

#### 2. Add GitHub CLI to Workflows
```yaml
# In all workflow files, add before GitHub operations:
- name: Install GitHub CLI
  run: |
    curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
    sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
    echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh -y
```

#### 3. Simplify MCP Integration
```yaml
# Replace complex MCP initialization with simpler fallback:
- name: Initialize MCP (with fallback)
  run: |
    # Try to install claude-flow
    npm install -g @ruvnet/claude-flow@alpha || echo "MCP installation failed, using fallback"
    
    # Use fallback if MCP not available  
    if ! command -v claude-flow &> /dev/null; then
      echo "MCP_AVAILABLE=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      echo "Using fallback mode without MCP integration"
    else
      echo "MCP_AVAILABLE=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    fi
```

### ðŸŸ¡ HIGH (Fix Within 24 Hours)

#### 4. Environment Parity Testing
```bash
# Create identical environment test:
# 1. Dockerfile that matches GitHub Actions runner
FROM ubuntu-latest:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3.11 nodejs npm
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
# Test in this environment
```

#### 5. Workflow Error Handling
```yaml
# Add comprehensive error handling to each workflow:
- name: Debug Environment
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "=== ENVIRONMENT DEBUG ==="
    echo "Python: $(python --version)"
    echo "Node: $(node --version)"  
    echo "NPM: $(npm --version)"
    echo "Working Dir: $(pwd)"
    echo "Python Path: $PYTHONPATH"
    echo "Available commands: $(which python pip npm node)"
    echo "=== DEPENDENCY CHECK ==="
    pip list | grep -E "(pytest|torch|numpy)"
    echo "=== FILE SYSTEM ==="
    ls -la
    ls -la tests/ || echo "Tests directory not found"
    ls -la tests/mocks/ || echo "Mocks directory not found"
```

### ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM (Fix Within Week)

#### 6. Isolated Test Environment
```yaml
# Create container-based testing that's environment-independent:
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: python:3.11-slim
      env:
        PYTHONPATH: /workspace/src:/workspace/packages:/workspace
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          path: /workspace
      - name: Install system dependencies
        run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y git curl
      - name: Install Python dependencies  
        working-directory: /workspace
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 7. MCP Server Health Monitoring
```python
# Add to workflow before MCP operations:
def check_mcp_availability():
    """Check if MCP servers are actually available and working"""
    try:
        # Test claude-flow installation
        result = subprocess.run(['npx', 'claude-flow', '--version'], 
                              capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
        if result.returncode != 0:
            return False
            
        # Test MCP server start
        result = subprocess.run(['npx', 'claude-flow', 'mcp', 'status'], 
                              capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
        return result.returncode == 0
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"MCP availability check failed: {e}")
        return False
```

## CORRECTED Success Metrics

### Immediate Success Indicators:
- [ ] `pytest tests/` runs without import errors
- [ ] At least one workflow completes successfully
- [ ] GitHub CLI commands work in workflows  
- [ ] Mock system doesn't cause import failures

### Technical Metrics:
- [ ] >90% of test files can import successfully
- [ ] Workflows complete within reasonable time (<15 minutes)

---

## CORRECTED Risk Assessment

### Actual Risk Level: **MEDIUM-HIGH**

**Why Not Critical**: The underlying code and dependencies are actually working. This appears to be primarily an environment and configuration issue, not a fundamental dependency crisis.

**Remaining Risks**:
1. **Testing Blocked**: Cannot validate code changes
2. **Security Scanning Limited**: Some security tools may not run  
3. **Deployment Pipeline**: May be affected but not necessarily broken
4. **Development Velocity**: Slowed by lack of CI/CD feedback

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Updated)

### RIGHT NOW (0-2 hours):
1. **Test Mock System Fix**: Implement error handling in `tests/mocks/__init__.py`
2. **Local Environment Test**: Run `pytest tests/` locally to confirm fix
3. **Simple Workflow Test**: Create minimal workflow that just runs basic tests

### TODAY (2-8 hours):  
1. **Add GitHub CLI to one workflow** and test
2. **Implement MCP fallback mode** in workflows
3. **Test end-to-end** on one simplified workflow
4. **Document working patterns** for other workflows

---

## Key Learning

**This analysis demonstrates the importance of**:
- Distinguishing between local environment and CI/CD environment issues
- Not assuming dependency problems when logs show compatibility errors
- Systematic verification of actual package installations vs. error messages
- Understanding that import chain failures can be environment-specific

The original diagnosis was based on error logs that suggested NumPy 2.x issues, but deeper analysis revealed the dependencies are correctly installed and the issue is in the test mocking system and CI environment configuration.
