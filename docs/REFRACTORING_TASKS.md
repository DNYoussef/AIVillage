# Refactoring Tasks

This document consolidates all refactoring tasks identified from the codebase documentation and analysis.

## Core System Refactoring

### Architecture & Design Patterns
- [ ] Standardize error handling and logging across all components and agents
- [x] Develop clear documentation explaining the system architecture, component interactions, and extension points
- [ ] Ensure consistent interfaces across all components and agent types
- [ ] Centralize common functionalities in the UnifiedBaseAgent class
- [ ] Review and optimize the communication protocol for inter-agent messaging
- [ ] Standardize task execution and message handling processes
- [ ] Merge similar functionalities into unified modules (e.g., concept extraction methods)
- [ ] Consider merging closely related agents (e.g., ReasoningAgent and ResponseGenerationAgent) if their functionalities overlap significantly
- [x] Document the specific roles and interactions of each agent type clearly
- [ ] Ensure proper integration between the RAG system and the agent framework

### Knowledge Management
- [ ] Review and optimize the knowledge graph update process
- [ ] Implement rollback and long-term persistence in KnowledgeTracker and KnowledgeEvolutionTracker
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of edge cases and unexpected inputs across all components

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Implement performance metrics and monitoring for all major components and agents
- [ ] Review and optimize the decision-making process in UnifiedDecisionMaker
- [ ] Ensure scalability of the system architecture for handling increased load and complexity
- [ ] Implement a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the system based on performance metrics and user feedback

### Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Implement a robust testing framework covering all major components and their interactions
- [ ] Conduct a final review and integration test of all changes

## RAG Pipeline Refactoring

### Core Components
- [ ] Replace temporary edge creation in GraphStore.add_documents with real similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity between embeddings)
- [ ] Expand UserIntentInterpreterAgent with keyword patterns described in docs/system_overview.md
- [ ] Implement a more robust creativity score in ExplorationMode._calculate_creativity_score by combining novelty and relevance of edges
- [ ] Refine the weighting scheme in ConfidenceEstimator beyond retrieval scores and response length

### Data & Embeddings
- [ ] Populate rag_system/utils/token_data with actual cl100k_base.tiktoken file from tiktoken project
- [ ] Provide deterministic fallback for BERTEmbeddingModel when Transformers library cannot load models (e.g., hashing tokens for reproducibility)

## Agent System Refactoring

### Self-Evolving System
- [ ] Replace stub SelfEvolvingSystem in agents/unified_base_agent.py with real integration of quality assurance, decision-making modules and capability evolution
- [ ] Replace evolution manager's random data generation with real datasets and evaluation metrics

### Training Pipeline
- [ ] Implement advanced phases such as Quiet-STaR, expert vectors and ADAS optimisation
- [ ] Move beyond basic model merging and simplified training loop
- [ ] Implement latent space activation and evolution methods to update latent_space with embeddings
- [ ] Implement simple averaging when evolving latent space

### Cognitive Components
- [ ] Implement simple query and update operations in Cognitive Nexus that call the reasoning engine and self-referential processor
- [ ] Detect early grokking events by monitoring gradient variance collapse and trigger adaptive hyperparameter boosts

## Implementation Tasks (Refactoring Perspective)

### Missing Features
- [ ] Implement KnowledgeTracker.rollback_change to reverse recorded modifications in knowledge graph
- [ ] Implement proper integration between RAG system and agent framework
- [ ] Ensure proper handling of edge cases across all components

### Security & Robustness
- [ ] Review and optimize security measures implemented during security sprints
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling and input validation across all components
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Migration Tasks

### Route Migration
- [ ] Complete migration of routes from server.py to microservices as outlined in docs/ROUTE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
- [ ] Ensure proper API versioning and backward compatibility
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new microservice architecture

## Documentation Refactoring

### Code Documentation
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions and classes
- [x] Update README files to reflect current architecture
- [ ] Create architecture decision records (ADRs) for major refactoring decisions
- [ ] Document API endpoints and usage patterns

### User Documentation
- [ ] Create user guides for system administrators
- [ ] Develop troubleshooting guides for common issues
- [ ] Document deployment and scaling procedures

## Notes

- This list consolidates tasks from refactor_analysis.md, implementation_tasks.md, comprehensive codebase analysis, and other documentation
- Tasks are organized by functional area and priority based on impact analysis
- Checkboxes indicate completion status (‚òê = pending, ‚òë = completed)
- Priority assignments reflect both technical debt severity and architectural importance
- Regular review and updates of this list should be part of the development process
- Foundation tasks should be completed before enhancement tasks to ensure system stability
