  - `ffi/` - Foreign function interface
  - `submission/` - Bounty submission artifacts

#### integrations/bounties/tmp/
- **Moved from**: `libs/p2p/bounty-tmp/`
- **Contains**: Temporary bounty development artifacts
- **Purpose**: Development and testing utilities

#### integrations/bridges/p2p/
- **Moved from**: `libs/p2p/bridges/`
- **Contains**: P2P bridge implementations
- **Key Files**:
  - `compatibility.py` - Cross-protocol compatibility
  - `rust_ffi.py` - Rust FFI bindings

### 3. Standalone Files
- **infrastructure/p2p/scion_gateway.py** - SCION network gateway

## Clean Architecture Compliance

### Infrastructure Layer Benefits
- **Clear Separation**: P2P infrastructure is now properly separated from business logic
- **Technology Independence**: Core business logic is isolated from P2P implementation details
- **Testability**: Infrastructure components can be mocked/replaced for testing
- **Maintainability**: P2P components are organized by function and protocol

### Integration Layer Benefits
- **External Concerns**: Bounty submissions and bridges are clearly external integrations
- **Loose Coupling**: Integration points are explicit and well-defined
- **Extensibility**: New integrations can be added without affecting core system

## Migration Impact

### Positive Outcomes
1. **Clean Boundaries**: Clear separation between infrastructure and business logic
2. **Better Organization**: Components grouped by responsibility and architectural layer
3. **Improved Testability**: Infrastructure can be easily mocked
4. **Maintainability**: Related components are co-located
5. **Scalability**: New P2P protocols can be added to infrastructure without affecting core

### Import Path Updates Required
Some import paths will need updates in consuming code:
```python
# Before
from libs.p2p.betanet import HtxClient
from libs.p2p.bitchat import BitChatTransport

# After
from infrastructure.p2p.betanet import HtxClient
from infrastructure.p2p.bitchat import BitChatTransport
```

### File Statistics
- **Total Python Files**: 52 files moved to infrastructure/p2p/
- **Rust Crates**: 12 complete Rust crates moved to integrations/bounties/
- **Configuration Files**: Multiple Cargo.toml, build scripts, and configs
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive bounty documentation and guides
- **Test Files**: Complete test suites for all components

## Next Steps
1. **Update Import Statements**: Scan codebase for import path updates
2. **Verify Functionality**: Run tests to ensure all components work correctly
3. **Update Documentation**: Update API documentation with new paths
4. **Dependency Review**: Verify all dependencies are correctly resolved

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify P2P infrastructure structure
find infrastructure/p2p -name "*.py" | wc -l  # Should show 52+ files

# Verify integrations structure
ls -la integrations/bounties/betanet/
ls -la integrations/bridges/p2p/

# Confirm old structure is removed
ls libs/p2p/  # Should show "No such file or directory"
```

## Conclusion
Phase 2.2 P2P infrastructure reorganization has been successfully completed. All P2P components have been properly relocated according to clean architecture principles, with infrastructure components in the infrastructure layer and external integrations in the integrations layer. The original `libs/p2p/` directory has been completely removed, and the new structure provides clear separation of concerns and improved maintainability.
