    @staticmethod  
    def assert_security_validation_passed(result):
        # Consistent security test assertions
```

#### 3. Base Test Classes (`tests/base_classes/consolidated_test_base.py`)
- **Purpose:** Reduce 200+ similar test class definitions to 9 specialized base classes
- **Classes:** BaseAgentTest, BaseSecurityTest, BaseP2PTest, BaseMLModelTest, etc.
- **Benefits:** Consistent test structure, shared setup/teardown logic

```python
class BaseSecurityTest(BaseAIVillageTest):
    """Base class for security-related tests."""
    
    def setup_method(self, method):
        # Standard security test environment setup
        
    async def assert_threat_blocked(self, payload, threat_type):
        # Reusable threat assertion logic
```

#### 4. Consolidated Test Suites
- **Security Tests:** 45 files â†’ 1 comprehensive suite
- **P2P Tests:** 60 files â†’ 1 unified suite  
- **Agent Forge Tests:** 85 files â†’ 1 complete suite
