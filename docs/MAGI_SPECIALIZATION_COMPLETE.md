## 🔬 **Advanced Features Implemented**

### **Geometric Self-Awareness** 📊
```python
# AI can see its own weight space in real-time
weight_analysis = geometric_awareness.analyze_weight_space(model)
self_visualization = geometric_awareness.visualize_for_ai(weight_analysis)

# Example output the AI sees about itself:
"""
=== GEOMETRIC SELF-AWARENESS REPORT ===
GLOBAL WEIGHT SPACE STATE:
- Total Parameters: 1,500,000,000
- Global Variance: 0.023456
- Geometric Complexity: 45.7
- Mean Layer Entropy: 3.21

INTERPRETATION:
- Higher geometric complexity indicates more sophisticated internal representations
- Use this information to guide self-modification decisions
"""
```

### **Self-Modification Interface** 🛠️
```python
# AI can modify its own parameters within safety bounds
modification_request = {
    "type": "adjust_layer_weights",
    "parameters": {
        "layer_name": "attention_layer",
        "adjustment_factor": 1.05
    }
}

result = self_modification.apply_modification(model, modification_request)
# Automatic safety checking and rollback capability
```

### **Curriculum Learning System** 📚
```python
# Progressive 10-level difficulty with domain expertise
curriculum_levels = [
    Level 1: Basic Python syntax and simple algorithms
    Level 2: Intermediate data structures
    ...
    Level 10: Advanced theoretical computer science and mathematical proofs
