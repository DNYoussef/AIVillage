# Confidence Estimation Development Plan for RAG System

## Current Status

The RAG system architecture includes a planned confidence estimation mechanism, but the core logic is not yet fully implemented.

*   **Planned but not fully implemented.** The architecture is designed for confidence estimation, but the core logic is missing.
*   **Placeholder implementation:** `rag_system/processing/confidence_estimator.py`'s `estimate_confidence` is a stub function that always returns a fixed value (0.95).
*   **Reasoning engine uses rule-based uncertainty:** `rag_system/processing/reasoning_engine.py` has its own basic, rule-based uncertainty estimation in the `_estimate_uncertainty` method, which is used for uncertainty tracking and propagation within the reasoning process.
*   **LLM prompt asks for confidence:** Prompts in `rag_system/processing/prompt_constructor.py` are designed to elicit confidence scores from the LLM, but this output is not currently used by the system.

## Development Plan

To fully implement confidence estimation and integrate it into the RAG system's uncertainty-aware reasoning, follow these steps:

1.  **Implement `confidence_estimator.py`:**
    *   **Goal:** Implement the `estimate_confidence` function in `rag_system/processing/confidence_estimator.py` to dynamically extract confidence scores from LLM responses.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Parsing LLM output:** Develop logic to parse the text response from the LLM (likely in `veracity_extrapolator.py` and `batch_processor.py`) and reliably extract a confidence value. Consider various formats in which confidence might be expressed (e.g., numerical scores, qualitative labels).
        *   **Confidence Estimation Method:** Decide on the method for confidence estimation. Options include:
            *   **Parsing and extracting from LLM's text response:**  Implement robust parsing logic.
            *   **Using a dedicated confidence estimation model:**  Integrate a separate, smaller model specifically for confidence estimation, or fine-tune the main LLM for confidence output.
        *   **Configuration:** Add configuration options in `rag_system/core/config.py` to control the confidence estimation method and any related parameters (e.g., thresholds, model selection).

2.  **Integrate `confidence_estimator.py` with `reasoning_engine.py`:**
    *   **Goal:** Modify `rag_system/processing/reasoning_engine.py` to use the dynamic confidence scores from `confidence_estimator.py` instead of its current rule-based `_estimate_uncertainty` method.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Remove `_estimate_uncertainty`:** Delete or refactor the `_estimate_uncertainty` method in `reasoning_engine.py`.
        *   **Call `estimate_confidence`:** Incorporate calls to `estimate_confidence` (likely indirectly, through `veracity_extrapolator.py` or `batch_processor.py` or a new dedicated module) within the reasoning process to obtain dynamic confidence scores for relevant facts, relations, or reasoning steps.
        *   **Use confidence in uncertainty propagation:** Ensure the `propagate_uncertainty` method in `reasoning_engine.py` uses these dynamically estimated confidence scores to calculate overall uncertainty.

3.  **Test and Evaluate:**
    *   **Goal:** Thoroughly test and evaluate the implemented confidence estimation and uncertainty-aware reasoning.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Accuracy of confidence scores:** Evaluate how accurately `confidence_estimator.py` estimates the confidence of LLM outputs. Use metrics relevant to confidence estimation (e.g., correlation with human judgments of confidence, calibration).
        *   **Impact on reasoning:** Assess whether uncertainty-aware reasoning, using dynamic confidence scores, improves the overall quality, reliability, and robustness of the RAG system's outputs. Compare performance with and without confidence estimation.
        *   **Performance overhead:** Measure the performance impact of adding confidence estimation. Optimize for efficiency if necessary.
        *   **Testing Framework:** Develop unit tests and integration tests to cover confidence estimation and uncertainty-aware reasoning functionalities.

4.  **Refine Prompts:**
    *   **Goal:** Optimize prompts to consistently elicit reliable confidence scores from the LLM.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   **Experiment with `construct_extrapolation_prompt`:**  Test different prompt phrasings and instructions in `rag_system/processing/prompt_constructor.py`, particularly in `construct_extrapolation_prompt`, to see which prompts lead to more accurate and consistently formatted confidence scores in LLM responses.
        *   **Prompt Engineering:** Apply prompt engineering techniques to improve the LLM's ability to express and provide confidence information.

## Prioritization

1.  **Implement `confidence_estimator.py` (core logic for confidence extraction).** - **Priority: High**
2.  **Integrate `confidence_estimator.py` with `reasoning_engine.py`.** - **Priority: High**
3.  **Test and Evaluate.** - **Priority: High**
4.  **Refine Prompts.** - **Priority: Medium**

This development plan provides a structured approach to implementing and integrating confidence estimation into the RAG system, enhancing its uncertainty-aware reasoning capabilities.
