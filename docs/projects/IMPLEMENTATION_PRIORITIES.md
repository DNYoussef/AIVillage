# Implementation Priority Matrix

## Critical (Blocks Everything)
- **Dependency failures**: `grokfast` package missing during installation – estimate 1d to adjust requirements or replace
- **Import path errors**: modules expect `AIVillage` package prefix – estimate 1d to refactor imports or package setup

## High (Blocks Major Features)
- **Distributed/P2P features**: peer discovery and mesh networking incomplete – estimate 3d
- **Resource monitoring on mobile**: battery and thermal metrics unimplemented – estimate 2d

## Medium (Enhances Functionality)
- **Performance optimization** for chat and guard components – estimate 2d
- **Comprehensive stub audit tooling** to track implementation progress – estimate 1d

## Low (Polish)
- UI improvements and additional connector integrations – estimate 3d
