# AIVillage Honest Status Report

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the AIVillage project. It is based on the in-depth analysis in `deprecated/old_reports/HONEST_STATUS_1.md`.

## Overall Project Completion

- **Estimated completion:** ~40%
- **Strengths:** clear architecture, extensive testing infrastructure, well defined agent interfaces
- **Gaps:** many core algorithms are stubs, components are not fully integrated, integration tests rely heavily on mocks

## Component Breakdown

| Component | Honest Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Model Compression** | ~45% | Real SeedLM implementation exists but other algorithms are stubs and configuration issues prevent production use |
| **Mesh Networking** | ~40% | Network formation works, but message routing tests show conflicting results |
| **Self‑Evolution** | ~20% | Framework code exists but is not wired into the agent system |
| **Agent Ecosystem** | ~25% | 8 agent types implemented; specialization and coordination are incomplete |
| **Federated Learning** | ~20% | Infrastructure present but not working end-to-end |
| **Mobile Optimization** | ~10% | Claims exist but no validation evidence |

## What Works Today

- Project structure and documentation are extensive.
- Network formation is functional.
- Testing framework is in place (though heavily mocked).
- Agent interfaces provide a solid starting point.

## Partial or Non‑Working Areas

- Compression algorithms beyond SeedLM remain stubs.
- Self‑evolution engine is disconnected from the rest of the codebase.
- Integration tests do not exercise real components.
- Production vs. experimental directories are not consistently enforced.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Integrate existing production implementations in place of stubs.
2. Replace mocked integration tests with real component tests.
3. Connect the self‑evolution engine to actual agent operations.
4. Validate mesh networking routing functionality.
