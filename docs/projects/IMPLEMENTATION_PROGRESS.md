# Implementation Progress

## Accomplished
- Removed unavailable experimental dependency `grokfast` and other heavyweight packages (`gym`, `torch`, etc.) so installation no longer hard‑fails on missing wheels
- Created a lightweight `AIVillage` namespace package that redirects imports to `src` and provides a legacy `AIVillage.src` path
- Added regression tests verifying the namespace alias and existing guard/runner functionality

## Metrics
- Stub occurrences: 378 (no change from last audit)
- Targeted tests: 19 passed / 0 failed (2 skipped)
- `make install`: incomplete – large dev dependencies cause long downloads; no missing-package errors after cleanup
- `make test`: fails during collection due to missing optional dependency `cryptography`

## Current State
- Core runtime and security gate modules load through the new namespace alias
- Installation still requires heavy optional tooling (Jupyter, Sphinx) and was aborted for time
- Full test suite blocked by uninstalled crypto libraries

## Next Steps
- Trim or gate remaining heavy dev dependencies to speed installation
- Provide optional stubs or conditionals around `cryptography`-based components
- Continue migrating modules away from placeholder stubs and add integration tests

## Timeline Estimate
- Dependency rationalization & stub guards: ~2 days
- Restoring full test pass after deps resolved: ~4 days
- Additional feature work per priority matrix: ongoing
