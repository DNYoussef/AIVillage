## Architecture Comparison

### Before: SimpleVectorStore System
```python
# Simple hash-based pseudo-vectors
vector = [float(hash(content + str(i)) % 1000) / 1000.0 for i in range(dimensions)]

# Basic similarity matching
query_words = set(query.lower().split())
content_words = set(content.lower().split())
overlap = len(query_words.intersection(content_words))
similarity = overlap / max(len(query_words), 1)
```

### After: Neural-Biological System
```python
# Hippocampus-inspired contextual embeddings
memory_trace = await hippo_rag.encode_memory(
    content=content,
    memory_type=MemoryType.EPISODIC,
    spatial_context=spatial_ctx,
    temporal_context=temporal_ctx,
    semantic_context=semantic_ctx
)

# Bayesian trust assessment
trust_score = await trust_network.get_trust_score(
    node_id, use_propagation=True, propagation_depth=3
)

# Cognitive reasoning synthesis
reasoning_result = await cognitive_engine.reason(
    query=query,
    evidence_sources=evidence_sources,
    require_multi_perspective=True
)
```
