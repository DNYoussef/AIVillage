*Auto-generated on 2025-08-19*

Based on git-churn Ã— complexity analysis, the following high-priority refactoring issues have been identified:

## Issue #1: Hotspot - Refactor transport_manager.py (HIGH risk)

**File**: `packages/p2p/core/transport_manager.py`
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Hotspot Score**: 47.3

### ðŸ“Š Metrics
- **Churn Score**: 52.1 (commits: 34, authors: 3)
- **Complexity Score**: 38.7 (LOC: 594, cyclomatic: 28)

### ðŸŽ¯ Recommendations
- Consider breaking down complex functions (high cyclomatic complexity)
- Frequently changed file - investigate instability causes
- High-priority refactoring candidate (high churn + complexity)

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- [ ] Review code structure and identify refactoring opportunities
- [ ] Add additional maintainers if bus factor is low
- [ ] Consider breaking down complex functions or large files
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for high-risk areas
- [ ] Update documentation for complex logic

## Summary

### Risk Level Distribution
- **HIGH**: 2 files (40%)
- **MEDIUM**: 3 files (60%)
- **LOW**: 0 files (0%)

### Key Findings
1. **P2P Transport Layer** needs immediate attention - high churn indicates instability
2. **Cost Management System** is becoming complex - consider architectural split
3. **Bus Factor Issues** - Several files have only 2 maintainers
4. **Large File Problem** - Multiple files over 600 LOC need modularization
5. **Testing Gaps** - High complexity files need comprehensive test coverage

### Prioritized Action Plan
1. **Week 1-2**: Address transport_manager.py refactoring (highest risk)
2. **Week 3-4**: Split distributed_cost_tracker.py into modules
3. **Week 5-6**: Add maintainers to bus factor risk files
4. **Week 7-8**: Create comprehensive tests for complex files
5. **Week 9-10**: Architectural review of remaining medium-risk files

### Process Improvements
- **Code Review**: Increase scrutiny for files with >500 LOC
- **Ownership**: Ensure minimum 3 maintainers per critical module
- **Testing**: Mandate >80% coverage for high-complexity files
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for files exceeding complexity thresholds
