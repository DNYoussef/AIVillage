# AIVillage Bus Factor Risk Management

## Overview

Bus Factor (also known as the "truck factor" or "lottery factor") refers to the minimum number of team members who would need to be unavailable (due to illness, vacation, leaving the company, etc.) before a project cannot proceed. This document outlines AIVillage's approach to identifying, measuring, and mitigating bus factor risks.

## What is Bus Factor Risk?

Bus factor risk occurs when:
- Critical knowledge is concentrated in too few people
- Key components have insufficient maintainers
- Documentation is inadequate for knowledge transfer
- Skills are not distributed across the team
- Single points of failure exist in the development process

## AIVillage Bus Factor Assessment

### Current Risk Areas

Based on our code hotspot analysis and CODEOWNERS review, the following areas have elevated bus factor risk:

#### 🚨 High Risk (Bus Factor: 1-2)

**Critical Infrastructure Components**
- `packages/core/cost_management/distributed_cost_tracker.py` - 2 maintainers
- `packages/edge/core/edge_manager.py` - 2 maintainers
- `packages/agent_forge/core/unified_pipeline.py` - 2 maintainers

**Specialized Knowledge Areas**
- **Rust BetaNet Implementation** - 1 primary maintainer (@rust-team lead)
- **Agent Forge 7-Phase Pipeline** - 2 maintainers (@ai-team)
- **Mobile Resource Optimization** - 2 maintainers (@mobile-team)

#### ⚠️ Medium Risk (Bus Factor: 2-3)

**Core Platform Components**
- `packages/p2p/core/transport_manager.py` - 3 maintainers
- `packages/rag/core/hyper_rag.py` - 3 maintainers
- `packages/agents/core/agent_orchestration_system.py` - 3 maintainers

**Cross-Cutting Concerns**
- **Security Implementation** - 3 maintainers (@security-team)
- **Deployment & Operations** - 3 maintainers (@devops-team)
- **Cost Management System** - 3 maintainers (@platform-team)

#### ✅ Low Risk (Bus Factor: 4+)

**Well-Distributed Areas**
- **Documentation** - 4+ maintainers (@docs-team, @platform-team)
- **Testing Infrastructure** - 4+ maintainers (@qa-team, @dev-team)
- **Frontend/UI Components** - 4+ maintainers (@frontend-team)

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
