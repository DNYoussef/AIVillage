## DoD Enforcement

### Pre-commit Validation

The following are automatically checked by pre-commit hooks:
- Code formatting (Black, Ruff)
- Import sorting (isort)
- Type checking (MyPy)
- Security scanning (Bandit)
- Secret detection

### CI/CD Validation

The 7-stage CI/CD pipeline enforces:
1. **Pre-flight Checks** - Syntax and critical security
2. **Code Quality** - Formatting, linting, type checking
3. **Testing** - Unit, integration, coverage tests
4. **Security Scanning** - Vulnerability and dependency checks
5. **Performance Testing** - Benchmark validation
6. **Build & Package** - Artifact creation
7. **Deployment** - Environment-specific validation

### Manual Review Gates

Code reviewers must verify:
- [ ] All automated checks pass
- [ ] DoD checklist completed
- [ ] Documentation is adequate
- [ ] Security considerations addressed
- [ ] Performance impact acceptable

## DoD Exceptions

In rare cases, DoD criteria may be waived with:

1. **Explicit approval** from 2 senior team members
2. **Technical debt ticket** created for missing items
3. **Timeline** for addressing exceptions (max 2 sprints)
4. **Risk assessment** documented

Exception reasons may include:
- Critical production hotfixes
- Time-sensitive security patches
- External dependency constraints
- Technical feasibility limitations

## DoD Evolution

This DoD will evolve with the project:

- **Monthly reviews** with team retrospectives
- **Criteria updates** based on lessons learned
- **Tool improvements** to automate more checks
- **Coverage increases** as project matures

## Success Metrics

DoD effectiveness is measured by:
- **Bug escape rate** to production
- **Security incident frequency**
- **Performance regression incidents**
- **Documentation completeness score**
- **Time to onboard new contributors**

## Getting Help

If you're unsure about DoD requirements:

1. **Ask in PR reviews** - Reviewers will help guide you
2. **Check examples** - Look at recently merged PRs
3. **Team chat** - Get quick clarification
4. **Office hours** - Weekly DoD Q&A sessions
