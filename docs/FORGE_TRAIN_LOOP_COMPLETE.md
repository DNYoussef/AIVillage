- **Phase transitions**: Automatic detection of grokking onset/completion

### Self-Modeling Networks
- Auxiliary heads predict internal activations
- Encourages compressed, predictable representations
- Improves stability and reduces parameter entropy

### Dream/Sleep Cycles
- **Consolidation**: Replay of challenging examples during "sleep"
- **Augmentation**: Systematic perturbations improve generalization
- **Memory**: Priority-based storage and retrieval of learning examples
