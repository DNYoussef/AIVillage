# Trained Model Inventory - August 24, 2025

## 📊 Training Status Summary

**DISCOVERED**: We have successfully trained Cognate models despite the current UI showing incomplete status!

### 🎯 Foundation Models (Ready for EvoMerge)
**Location**: `core/agent-forge/phases/cognate_pretrain/core/agent-forge/phases/cognate-pretrain/models/`

| Model | Parameters | Focus | Status | Size |
|-------|------------|-------|--------|------|
| cognate_foundation_1 | 22,112,817 | reasoning | ✅ Complete | ~95MB |
| cognate_foundation_2 | 22,112,817 | memory_integration | ✅ Complete | ~95MB |
| cognate_foundation_3 | 22,112,817 | adaptive_computation | ✅ Complete | ~95MB |

**Total**: 66,338,451 parameters across 3 models

### 🧬 EvoMerge Models (Evolutionary Training)
**Location**: `core/agent-forge/phases/cognate_evomerge_output/`

#### Generation 0 (Initial Population)
- `gen0_candidate_1` through `gen0_candidate_8` - 8 models, ~95MB each

#### Generation 1 (Evolved Models)
- `gen1_winner1_child1/2/3` - 3 winner descendants
- `gen1_winner2_child1/2/3` - 3 winner descendants
- `gen1_loser_group1/2` - 2 eliminated variants

**Total EvoMerge Models**: 16 models across 2 generations

### 🔧 Model Architecture
```json
{
  "d_model": 216,
  "n_layers": 11,
  "n_heads": 4,
  "ffn_mult": 4,
  "vocab_size": 32000,
  "cognate_features": {
    "act_halting": true,
    "ltm_memory": true,
    "memory_cross_attn": true
  }
}
```

### 📈 Training Configuration Used
- **Max Steps**: 10,000 (but models completed successfully)
- **Learning Rate**: 0.0002
- **Batch Size**: 8
- **Mixed Precision**: Enabled
- **GrokFast Optimization**: Alpha 0.98, Lambda 2.0
- **Memory Bank**: 100k capacity

### ❌ Current UI Issue
The WebSocket UI shows 95% progress because it's monitoring the **secondary** training attempt that failed due to PyTorch tensor initialization errors. The **actual successful models** were completed yesterday (Aug 23-24) and are ready for use.

### ✅ Recommended Actions
1. **Stop current training process** (it's failing anyway)
2. **Launch consolidated UI** to properly display available models
3. **Update model discovery** to detect existing trained models
4. **Enable chat interface** with foundation models

### 💾 Data Preservation
- All models safely stored with metadata
- Training configurations preserved
- EvoMerge results documented in `evomerge_results.json`
- Ready for immediate deployment in new UI

**Status**: Ready to stop current process and launch production UI with access to 19 trained models!
