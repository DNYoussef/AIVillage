# AIVillage Architecture

AIVillage is a self-evolving AI infrastructure platform that has evolved from a monolithic Python project into a distributed system with prototype components, experimental microservices, and autonomous evolution capabilities. Testing remains limited (5 of 24 integration tests passing per `integration_test_results.json`).

## System Architecture Overview

The platform is organized into three main layers:

1. **Production Layer**: Prototype components targeting production readiness
2. **Experimental Layer**: Development components with evolving APIs
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Core deployment and communication systems
