# Deprecated Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation files that made premature or misleading success claims about AIVillage components. These files have been archived to maintain historical record while preventing confusion about the actual project status.

**Reality**: Project is in active development with many experimental components

### MESH_NETWORK_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
**Reason**: Claimed production-ready mesh networking capabilities
**Reality**: Mesh networking is 20% complete and experimental

### CODEBASE_TRANSFORMATION_SUMMARY.md
**Reason**: Overstated completeness and transformation success
**Reality**: Codebase contains mix of production-ready and experimental components
