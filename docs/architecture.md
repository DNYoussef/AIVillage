# Architecture

The repository started as a monolithic Python project. It now includes two
microservices â€“ a Gateway and the Twin runtime â€“ which communicate over HTTP.
gRPC/WebSocket support proposed in ADR-0002 is not yet implemented.
Most other modules remain in-process libraries. Quiet-STaR and expert vectors
remain stubs, while a basic ADAS prototype is available.
