# Integration Notes

## Duplicate Classes

* `DummyModel`
* `DummyAgent`
* `TestKingAgent`
* `TestLayerSequence`

## Conflicting Imports

* `p2p_node` is imported from multiple locations.
* `json` is used extensively, which could lead to data format inconsistencies.
* `torch` is used in multiple places, which could lead to version conflicts.

## Mismatched API Signatures

* The `/v1/chat` endpoint in the Digital Twin API has a different signature than the one in the gateway.
* The `/healthz` endpoint has different response models in the Digital Twin API and the gateway.

## Circular Dependencies

* The `king` agent seems to have a circular dependency with the `evolution_manager`.
* The `sage` agent seems to have a circular dependency with the `rag_system`.
