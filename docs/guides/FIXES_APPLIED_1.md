# Critical Core Files Fixes Applied

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 🔧 **Build System & Dependencies**
1. **Fixed Makefile tabs/spaces issues** (Lines 15, 18, 21)
   - Converted spaces to proper tabs for make compatibility
   - Added missing `install` and `install-dev` targets
   - Fixed `ruff` command to include `check` subcommand

2. **Resolved dependency management conflicts**
   - Removed conflicting `setup.cfg` (setuptools)
   - Kept `pyproject.toml` (Poetry) as primary dependency manager
   - Cleaned up `requirements.txt` duplicate dependencies
   - Added clear warnings about auto-generation

### 🐛 **Critical Code Fixes**

#### **main.py Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Removed unused import alias `Task as LangroidTask`
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded config with external YAML file loading
- ✅ Fixed blocking input in async context using `run_in_executor`
- ✅ Added proper CLI argument parsing with Click
- ✅ Added configuration validation and error handling
- ✅ Added verbose logging option

#### **server.py Production Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added API_KEY environment variable validation
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded dummy data with placeholder + warning
- ✅ Made rate limiter configuration environment-driven
- ✅ Moved hardcoded constants to configurable environment variables
- ✅ Added production warnings for in-memory components

### 🐳 **Docker Configuration**
- ✅ Consolidated `docker-compose.yml` + `docker-compose.override.yml`
- ✅ Added proper version specification
- ✅ Made monitoring services optional with profiles
- ✅ Added environment variable defaults
- ✅ Unified networking configuration

## ⚠️ **Security & Production Readiness**

### Fixed Issues:
- Environment variable validation
- Rate limiter production warnings
- Removed hardcoded credentials/dummy data
- Added proper error handling

### Still Needs Attention:
- Replace in-memory rate limiter with Redis for production
- Implement actual evidence pack retrieval logic
- Add comprehensive input validation
- Set up proper secret management

## 📝 **Usage Changes**

### New CLI Usage:
```bash
# Use custom config file
python main.py --config configs/custom.yaml

# Enable verbose logging
python main.py --verbose

# Both options
python main.py -c configs/prod.yaml -v
```

### Docker Usage:
```bash
# Basic services only
docker compose up

# Include monitoring stack
docker compose --profile monitoring up
```

### Environment Variables:
```bash
export API_KEY="your-api-key"
export MAX_FILE_SIZE=104857600  # 100MB
export RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=200
export GRAFANA_PASSWORD="secure-password"
```

## 🏗️ **Build System Priority**
Poetry is now the primary dependency manager:
- Use `poetry install` for setup
- Use `poetry add <package>` for new dependencies
- `requirements.txt` is auto-generated - don't edit directly

✅ **All critical redundancies and mistakes identified have been resolved.**
