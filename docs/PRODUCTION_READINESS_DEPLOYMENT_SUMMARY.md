## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancements

### 1. Analytics Infrastructure
```python
# Before: NotImplementedError
def record_metric(self, metric: str, value: float) -> None:
    raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement record_metric")

# After: Production Implementation
def record_metric(self, metric: str, value: float, timestamp: Optional[datetime] = None) -> None:
    """Record a metric value with timestamp and apply retention policies."""
    if timestamp is None:
        timestamp = datetime.now()
        
    if metric not in self.metrics:
        self.metrics[metric] = []
        self.timestamps[metric] = []
        
    self.metrics[metric].append(value)
    self.timestamps[metric].append(timestamp)
    # ... retention policy application
```

### 2. Enhanced Processing Interface
```python
class EnhancedProcessingInterface(ABC, Generic[T, U]):
    """Production-grade processing with monitoring, retries, and circuit breakers."""
    
    async def process(self, input_data: T, context: Optional[ProcessingContext] = None) -> ProcessResult[U]:
        # Comprehensive error handling, progress tracking, resource management
        # Circuit breaker pattern, timeout handling, metrics collection
```

### 3. Comprehensive Monitoring
```python
class SystemMetricsManager:
    """System-wide metrics collection and monitoring."""
    # CPU, memory, disk, network monitoring
    # Configurable thresholds and alerting
    # Real-time health scoring
    
class AgentMetricsCollector:
    """Agent-specific performance tracking."""
    # Task processing metrics
    # Success/failure rates
    # Performance trending
    
class SystemHealthMonitor:
    """Health checking with automatic recovery."""
    # HTTP, database, system resource checks
    # Alert handlers and notifications
    # Recovery suggestions
```
