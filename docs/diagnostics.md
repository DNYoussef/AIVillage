# CI/CD Failure Diagnostics

## Top Failure Patterns from GitHub Actions
1. **Dependency installation failures** – Many workflows (e.g., AIVillage Test Suite, Tests) fail during `pip install -r requirements.txt`, causing subsequent steps to be skipped.
2. **Formatting checks failing** – The Continuous Integration workflow reports `Run Black formatter check` failing, halting remaining lint steps.
3. **Pre-commit hook failures** – The dedicated Lint workflow fails at `pre-commit run --all-files`, indicating conflicting or unmet linting requirements.
4. **Job setup failures** – Several workflows (API Documentation, Performance Regression Check) show `Set up job` failing before any custom steps execute.
5. **Early step cancellations** – When a critical step fails (e.g., dependency install), later steps such as tests, coverage, or performance checks are marked as `skipped` or `cancelled`, leading to incomplete runs.

## Local Linting Tool Conflicts
- `black --check .` reports 11 files needing reformatting and one file with a syntax error (`scripts/final_benchmark_report.py`).
- `ruff check .` produces extensive warnings and errors (e.g., missing type annotations, line-length violations, logging style issues), overlapping with Flake8 and isort.
- `flake8 .` flags line-length violations, ambiguous variable names, comparisons to True/False, and unused imports in tests and tools.
- `isort --check .` reports import-sorting issues across hundreds of files, indicating conflicting import conventions.
- `mypy .` fails immediately due to unsupported `python_version` (3.8) in configuration and a syntax error in `scripts/archive/align_documentation.py`.

These results highlight significant overlap and misalignment among the current linting tools, contributing to the CI failures.
