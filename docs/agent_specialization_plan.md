# AI Village Agent Specialization Pipeline

## Overview
Using the optimal base configuration (Task Arithmetic, scaling=1.31) to create specialized agent variants for the AI Village architecture.

## Base Configuration
- **Foundation Model**: Task Arithmetic merge with scaling coefficient 1.3131
- **Source Models**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, Nemotron-4-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B, Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct
- **Base Fitness**: 1.6185
- **All Benchmarks**: Exceeded targets (MMLU: 0.737, GSM8K: 0.664, HumanEval: 0.427)
