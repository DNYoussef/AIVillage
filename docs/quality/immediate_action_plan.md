## üéØ Week 1: Emergency Stabilization

### Day 1-2: Codebase Freeze & Assessment
- [ ] **IMMEDIATE:** Freeze new feature development in critical God Object files
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Create emergency refactoring branch: `emergency/god-object-elimination`
- [ ] **HIGH:** Establish behavioral test coverage for BaseAgentTemplate (currently 0%)
- [ ] **HIGH:** Document all 23 agent dependencies on BaseAgentTemplate

#### Critical Files Under Feature Freeze:
```
packages/agents/core/base_agent_template.py              (845 LOC, 23 dependencies)
packages/agents/core/agent_orchestration_system.py      (777 LOC, core system)  
packages/agents/specialized/culture_making/horticulturist_agent.py (913 LOC)
packages/core/compliance/pii_phi_manager.py             (1,772 LOC, compliance risk)
```

### Day 3-5: Emergency Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Implement characterization tests for BaseAgentTemplate
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Create integration test suite for agent orchestration
- [ ] **HIGH:** Establish performance baseline measurements
- [ ] **HIGH:** Set up architectural fitness functions (basic subset)

#### Test Coverage Requirements:
- BaseAgentTemplate: 100% characterization coverage
- AgentOrchestrationSystem: 90% integration coverage  
- Critical agent interactions: 95% coverage
- PII/PHI operations: 100% compliance coverage

## üîß Week 2-3: Critical Refactoring

### BaseAgentTemplate Decomposition (Priority P0)
**File:** `packages/agents/core/base_agent_template.py`  
**Current State:** 845 lines, 5 methods, affects 23 specialized agents  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL (system-wide impact)

#### Extraction Plan:
```python
# Target Architecture:
BaseAgentTemplate (coordination only)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentCommunication     # messaging & RPC
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentLifecycle        # init, start, stop, cleanup  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentMonitoring       # metrics, health, logging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentSecurity         # auth, encryption, rbac
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ AgentConfiguration    # settings, validation, env
```

#### Day 6-10: Extract Communication Layer
- [ ] Create `AgentCommunication` class with messaging abstraction
- [ ] Move all RPC and inter-agent communication logic
- [ ] Implement adapter pattern for backward compatibility
- [ ] Validate with specialized agent subset (3-5 agents)

#### Day 11-15: Extract Lifecycle Management  
- [ ] Create `AgentLifecycle` class with state management
- [ ] Move initialization, startup, and cleanup logic
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for failures
- [ ] Test with full agent suite

### Agent Orchestration Refactoring (Priority P0)
**File:** `packages/agents/core/agent_orchestration_system.py`  
**Current State:** 777 lines, 2 massive methods  
**Risk Level:** HIGH (core infrastructure)

#### Day 11-15: Service Layer Extraction
- [ ] Extract `OrchestrationService` with command pattern
- [ ] Create `AgentRegistry` for discovery and registration
- [ ] Implement `TaskDistributor` with load balancing
- [ ] Add `HealthMonitor` with circuit breaker pattern

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Week 3-4: Compliance & Security

### PII/PHI Manager Emergency Refactoring (Priority P1)
**File:** `packages/core/compliance/pii_phi_manager.py`  
**Current State:** 1,772 lines, compliance risk  
**Risk Level:** CRITICAL (regulatory exposure)

#### Regulatory Compliance Requirements:
- [ ] **GDPR:** Data processing audit trail
- [ ] **HIPAA:** Healthcare data encryption
- [ ] **SOX:** Financial data integrity
- [ ] **CCPA:** Consumer data rights

#### Day 16-20: Data Protection Layer
- [ ] Extract `DataClassifier` for PII/PHI identification
- [ ] Create `EncryptionService` with key rotation
- [ ] Implement `AuditTrail` with immutable logging
- [ ] Add `ConsentManager` for data usage tracking

#### Day 21-25: Compliance Validation
- [ ] Create compliance test suite
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Add breach detection and notification
- [ ] Validate with security audit team

## üö® Risk Mitigation & Contingency

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Agent System Failure**
   - **Risk:** BaseAgentTemplate changes break specialized agents
   - **Mitigation:** Incremental rollout with canary deployment
   - **Rollback:** Automated rollback within 5 minutes

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - **Risk:** Refactoring introduces latency
   - **Mitigation:** Performance testing at each step
   - **Rollback:** Performance threshold alerts with auto-rollback

3. **Compliance Violation**
   - **Risk:** PII/PHI exposure during refactoring
   - **Mitigation:** Data masking in non-production environments
   - **Rollback:** Immediate isolation and incident response

### Contingency Plans
```yaml
Scenario: Critical failure during refactoring
Response: 
  - Immediate rollback to previous stable version
  - Emergency hotfix deployment pipeline
  - 24/7 engineering team availability
  - Executive stakeholder notification

Scenario: Regulatory compliance failure
Response:
  - Immediate data protection team engagement
  - Legal team notification
  - Compliance officer escalation
  - Customer communication plan activation
```
