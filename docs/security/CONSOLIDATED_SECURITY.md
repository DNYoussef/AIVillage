# Security - Consolidated Documentation

## üéØ Security Framework Overview

AIVillage implements a comprehensive, enterprise-grade security framework with **Zero Critical Issues Baseline** achieving an **Overall Security Rating: B+ (85/100)**. The platform operates with military-grade encryption, automated security operations, and comprehensive compliance frameworks across all system components.

### Security Architecture Philosophy
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers at every system level
- **Zero Trust Network Architecture**: No implicit trust, explicit verification required
- **Privacy-by-Design**: Data sovereignty with mathematically proven privacy guarantees
- **Automated Security Operations**: Self-healing controls with 24/7 monitoring
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Business impact-driven prioritization

## üîí Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Framework
```yaml
mfa_requirements:
  admin_accounts: "hardware_token"
  developer_accounts: "totp_app"
  service_accounts: "certificate_based"
  user_accounts: "sms_or_app"

password_policy:
  min_length: 14
  complexity: "upper+lower+numbers+symbols"
  history: 24
  max_age: 90
  lockout_threshold: 3
  lockout_duration: 30
```

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **UserRole Hierarchy**: GUEST(0) ‚Üí USER(1) ‚Üí MODERATOR(2) ‚Üí ADMIN(3) ‚Üí SUPER_ADMIN(4)
- **Privileged Access Management**: Just-in-time elevation with session recording
- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Pod security policies with non-root execution
- **Zero Standing Privileges**: All administrative access requires explicit approval

### Multi-Tenant Isolation

#### Network Segmentation (Zero Trust)
```yaml
network_zones:
  dmz:
    description: "External-facing services"
    ingress: ["80", "443", "22"]
    monitoring: "full_packet_inspection"

  internal_services:
    description: "Business logic services"
    ingress: ["dmz", "internal_services"]
    monitoring: "flow_logs"

  database:
    description: "Data persistence layer"
    ingress: ["internal_services"]
    monitoring: "database_activity_monitoring"
```

#### Data Encryption Standards
- **Data at Rest**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 with hardware acceleration
- **Data in Transit**: AES-256-GCM + TLS 1.3 + mTLS
- **P2P Communications**: End-to-end encryption with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
- **Key Management**: HSM-backed key rotation with 24-hour lifecycle

### Compliance Management

#### Current Compliance Status
| Regulation | Compliance Level | Gaps | Target Date |
|------------|------------------|------|-------------|
| **GDPR** | 85% | Data mapping, breach notification automation | Q2 2024 |
| **COPPA** | 90% | Age verification enhancements | Q1 2024 |
| **FERPA** | 88% | Education record handling procedures | Q2 2024 |

## ‚ùå SECURITY REALITY GAP

### Implementation Gaps:
1. **Image Security Workflow Gap**: 4 security tools missing integration (detect-secrets, bandit, safety, semgrep)
2. **Main CI Compliance Gap**: Missing specific compliance reporting features (cryptographic validation, anti-pattern detection)
3. **SCION Production Gap**: Production security gate implementation incomplete
4. **Architecture Quality Gap**: Security gate validation missing from architectural quality workflow

### Threat Coverage Gaps:
1. **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Gap**: Future-proofing against quantum computing threats (planned for Q2 2024)
2. **Advanced Analytics Gap**: Predictive security intelligence platform (70% improvement in threat prediction expected)
3. **Zero-Trust Complete Gap**: Full network segmentation implementation (40% reduction in lateral movement attacks expected)

### Critical Security Debt:
- **Container Image Scanning**: Enhanced security tool integration needed for complete coverage
- **Architectural Security Integration**: Security gates need full integration across all quality workflows
- **Advanced Threat Detection**: ML-based anomaly detection system deployment pending
- **Quantum-Resistant Migration**: Cryptographic algorithm future-proofing required

### Security Resolution Priorities:
1. **CRITICAL**: Complete container security tool integration (1-2 weeks)
2. **HIGH**: Implement missing CI/CD compliance reporting (2-4 weeks)
3. **MEDIUM**: Deploy advanced threat detection system (1-3 months)
