# Security Governance Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the security governance framework implemented for the AIVillage project. The implementation follows enterprise-grade security practices while maintaining developer productivity and adhering to connascence principles for clean architecture.

## 📋 Implementation Summary

### Completed Components ✅

1. **SECURITY.md** - Comprehensive vulnerability reporting process with SLA commitments
2. **Enhanced Issue Templates** - Security-integrated bug reporting and vulnerability templates
3. **Advanced PR Template** - Threat modeling and security assessment integration
4. **Security Compliance Workflow** - Automated SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
5. **Risk Labeling System** - Automated security risk assessment and labeling

### Architecture Compliance 🏗️

The security implementation follows connascence principles:

- **Weak Connascence**: Security modules use well-defined interfaces and configuration
- **Local Strong Connascence**: Security validation logic contained within security-focused modules
- **Dependency Injection**: Security services configurable and testable
- **Single Responsibility**: Each security component has a focused purpose
