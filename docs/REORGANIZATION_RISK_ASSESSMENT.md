# AIVillage Reorganization - Risk Assessment & Mitigation

## Executive Risk Summary

The AIVillage reorganization involves migrating 729 Python files across 15 packages while maintaining system functionality. This assessment identifies critical risks, their probability and impact, and comprehensive mitigation strategies.

## Risk Classification Framework

### Risk Levels
