Overview of the RAG System
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to serve as a shared repository of village memories. Agents can query this system to retrieve information from the collective knowledge base. The system combines retrieval mechanisms with generative capabilities to provide informative answers.

Pipeline Processing Steps
Based on the provided code and folder structure, here's how the system pipeline likely functions:

1. Configuration Setup
RAGConfig (from core.config): Manages configuration settings, including paths, model parameters, and other essential settings required for the system's operation.
2. Query Processing Pipeline
EnhancedRAGPipeline (from core.pipeline): The primary component responsible for processing queries submitted by agents.
The process(query) method (or its process_query wrapper) likely follows these steps:

a. Input Processing
Input Pipeline (from input_pipeline/):

Tokenization and Normalization: The query is tokenized and normalized to prepare it for further processing.
Embedding Generation: Uses embedding_generator.py to convert the query into a vector representation suitable for similarity search.
b. Retrieval
Retrieval Module (from retrieval/):

Vector Store Search: The query vector is compared against document vectors in a vector store to find the most relevant documents.
Similarity Scoring: Calculates similarity scores to rank documents based on relevance to the query.
c. Document Processing
Processing Module (from processing/):

Information Extraction: Extracts pertinent information from the retrieved documents.
Summarization: Summarizes key points that directly address the query.
Filtering: Removes irrelevant or less significant data to focus on the most relevant content.
d. Answer Generation
Answer Synthesis:

Generative Models: Utilizes a language generation model to formulate a coherent and contextually appropriate answer.
Template Application: May apply predefined templates to structure the response effectively.
e. Confidence Scoring
Assessment Module:

Confidence Calculation: Assigns a confidence score based on factors like document relevance and the certainty of the language model.
Thresholding: Determines if the confidence level is sufficient to provide an answer or if additional processing is needed.
3. Document Management
DocumentManager (from data_management/document_manager.py):

Adding Documents: Agents can add new documents using add_document(content, filename).
Updating Indexes: Updates the vector store and indexes to include new documents for future queries.
4. System Analysis
SystemAnalyzer (from analysis/system_analyzer.py):

Structure Analysis: Examines the system's components and their interactions.
Performance Metrics: Assesses response times, accuracy, and other performance indicators.
Optimization Suggestions: Identifies bottlenecks and suggests improvements.
5. Logging and Tracking
Logging (from utils.logging):

Event Logging: Records significant events, errors, and system statuses.
Debugging Support: Provides detailed logs to assist in troubleshooting.
Tracking Module (from tracking/):

Query Tracking: Monitors queries processed by the system.
Usage Statistics: Collects data on system utilization for analysis.
Calculation and Derivation of Answers
The system calculates and derives answers through the following process:

Query Embedding:
Converts the input query into a high-dimensional vector using embedding techniques.
Captures semantic meaning to facilitate effective retrieval.

Document Retrieval:
Searches the vector store for documents with embeddings similar to the query.
Retrieves a ranked list of relevant documents based on similarity scores.

Information Extraction:
Parses retrieved documents to extract sections pertinent to the query.
Uses natural language processing techniques to identify key information.

Answer Generation:
Synthesizes the extracted information into a cohesive answer.
May employ generative language models to produce fluent and contextually appropriate responses.

Confidence Scoring:
Calculates a confidence score reflecting the answer's reliability.
Factors in document relevance, extraction quality, and model certainty.

Final Response Assembly:
Compiles the answer, confidence score, and any supporting evidence into the final output.
Ensures the response is well-structured and informative.

Expected Output Format
Agents can expect to receive answers in a structured format, likely as a JSON object or Python dictionary, containing:

answer: The generated response to the query.

confidence_score: A numerical value (e.g., between 0 and 1) indicating the system's confidence in the provided answer.

source_documents: A list of documents or snippets that were used to formulate the answer. Each entry may include:

document_name: The name or identifier of the document.
snippet: A relevant excerpt from the document.
relevance_score: Indicates how closely the document matches the query.
metadata (optional): Additional information such as processing time or query identifiers.

Example Output
{
  "answer": "The village celebrates the Spring Equinox Festival and the Harvest Moon Festival each year.",
  "confidence_score": 0.88,
  "source_documents": [
    {
      "document_name": "festivals_guide.txt",
      "snippet": "The Spring Equinox Festival marks the start of the planting season...",
      "relevance_score": 0.95
    },
    {
      "document_name": "annual_events.docx",
      "snippet": "Each year, the Harvest Moon Festival brings the community together...",
      "relevance_score": 0.90
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "processing_time_ms": 134,
    "query_id": "q123456"
  }
}
How Agents Would Use the RAG System
Agents interact with the RAG system by importing the necessary modules and submitting their queries through the pipeline.

Code Example
import asyncio
from core.config import RAGConfig
from core.pipeline import EnhancedRAGPipeline

async def agent_query():
    # Initialize configuration and pipeline
    config = RAGConfig()
    pipeline = EnhancedRAGPipeline(config)
    
    # Define the query
    query = "What festivals does the village celebrate each year?"
    
    # Process the query
    result = await pipeline.process(query)
    
    # Access the results
    answer = result.get('answer')
    confidence_score = result.get('confidence_score')
    source_documents = result.get('source_documents', [])
    metadata = result.get('metadata', {})
    
    # Display the answer and additional information
    print(f"Answer: {answer}")
    print(f"Confidence Score: {confidence_score}")
    print("\nSource Documents:")
    for doc in source_documents:
        print(f"- {doc.get('document_name')}: {doc.get('snippet')}")
    print(f"\nMetadata: {metadata}")

# Run the asynchronous agent query
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(agent_query())
Explanation
Initialization: Agents create instances of RAGConfig and EnhancedRAGPipeline to set up the system.

Submitting a Query: Agents define their query as a string.

Processing the Query: Use await pipeline.process(query) (or pipeline.process_query) to process the query asynchronously.

Handling the Result: Extract the answer, confidence_score, source_documents, and metadata from the result.

Interpreting the Output:

Answer: The main response to the query.
Confidence Score: Indicates the reliability of the answer.
Source Documents: Provides context and justification for the answer.
Metadata: Contains additional data such as processing time.
Conclusion
Pipeline Workflow: The RAG system processes queries through a series of steps, including input processing, retrieval, document processing, answer generation, and confidence scoring.

Answer Derivation: Answers are derived by retrieving relevant documents from the vector store, extracting pertinent information, and generating a response using language models.

Expected Output: Agents receive a structured response containing the answer, confidence score, source documents, and optional metadata.

Agent Interaction: Agents interact with the system programmatically, utilizing asynchronous calls to submit queries and handle responses.
