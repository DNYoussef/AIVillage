### Trust-Weighted Retrieval
```python
# Bayesian scoring combining multiple signals
trust_score = (prior * likelihood * context_factor) + cross_reference_bonus
```

- Likelihood: Base retrieval similarity score
- Context factor: Temporal/geographic relevance
- Cross-reference bonus: Knowledge graph connections

### Hierarchical Context Structure
```python
HierarchicalContext:
  - global_summary: Article-level overview
  - local_details: Section-specific information
  - section_hierarchy: Document structure
  - parent_topics: Broader concepts
  - child_topics: Specific subtopics
  - temporal_context: Time periods
  - geographic_context: Locations
  - cross_references: Related articles
```
