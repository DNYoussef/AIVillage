## Coordination Protocol
```python
# Swarm coordinator manages parallel execution
coordinator = SwarmCoordinator(
    agents=9,
    topology='hierarchical',
    sync_points=['architecture', 'implementation', 'testing', 'delivery']
)

# Execute with progress tracking
results = await coordinator.execute_swarm(
    phase="quietstar",
    parallel=True,
    timeout=3600
)
```
