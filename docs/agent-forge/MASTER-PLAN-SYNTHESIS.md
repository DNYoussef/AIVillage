# Agent Forge Master Plan - Synthesis of All 5 Cycles

## Executive Summary

After 5 comprehensive cycles of research, planning, and analysis, this master plan synthesizes all findings into a definitive roadmap for the Agent Forge system implementation. The system will transform base models into specialized, compressed AI agents through an 8-phase pipeline, achieving 95% compression while maintaining quality.

## Current State vs Target State

    track1 = asyncio.create_task(
        execute_sequential([
            phase2_evomerge,
            phase3_quietstar,
            phase5_training
        ])

            phase6_baking,
            phase7_adas
        ])
    )

    # Synchronization points
    evolved = await track1
