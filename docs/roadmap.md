# Agent Forge Roadmap

This short roadmap clarifies the current state of the project and highlights planned features. The geometry-aware modules described in `geometry_aware_training.md` are now included as experimental components.

## Implemented
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (basic pipeline)
- FastAPI server with simple query endpoint
- Initial EvoMerge utilities for model merging
- Geometry-aware training helpers (Two-NN ID estimator, Grokfast optimizer, Edge-of-Chaos PID, SleepNet/DreamNet stubs, BitNet quantization)

## In Progress / Planned
- Quiet-STaR thought generation
- Self-evolving agent system with expert vectors
- Full evolutionary training pipeline (see `complete_agent_forge_pipeline.md`)
- ADAS optimisation and advanced compression

The roadmap will be updated as milestones are completed.
