### üéØ Constitutional Principles Implementation

#### First Amendment Protections
```python

# Protected speech categories get heightened scrutiny  
protected_categories = [
    "political_speech", "religious_expression", "artistic_expression",
    "scientific_discourse", "social_commentary", "news_reporting"
]

if protected_speech_detected and confidence < 0.9:
    return PolicyDecision.ESCALATE  # Human constitutional review
```

#### Viewpoint Neutrality Enforcement
```python
# Bias detection and mitigation
viewpoint_bias_score = calculate_viewpoint_bias(content, classification)

if viewpoint_bias_score > 0.3:
    apply_viewpoint_firewall()  # Silver/Gold tier protection
    require_bias_monitoring()
    flag_for_constitutional_review()
```

#### Due Process Safeguards
```python
# Notice requirements
if decision in ["restrict", "quarantine", "block"]:
    provide_clear_rationale()
    cite_applicable_policies()
    notify_appeal_rights()
    preserve_evidence()

# Proportionality analysis
