# Ultimate Two-Stage Extreme Compression Framework for LLMs

This document summarizes a proposed pipeline for compressing large language models by more than 30× with less than 5% accuracy loss. It is adapted from the user-provided instructions and is included here for reference when extending the Agent Forge system.

The approach contains two main stages:

1. **Training-Time Efficiency**
   - *BitNet Fine-tuning*: convert linear layers to ternary weights using a straight-through estimator and RMSNorm stabilization.
   - *SeedLM Encoding*: represent weights as pseudo‑random linear combinations of LFSR-generated basis vectors.

2. **Deployment Optimization**
   - *VPTQ Quantization*: apply Hessian-weighted vector quantization to the SeedLM‑decompressed weights.
   - *Hyper‑Compression*: optionally use ergodic "hyperfunction" encoding for additional reduction.

The framework also describes CUDA kernels, benchmarking utilities, and deployment tools for edge devices. It suggests a benchmark harness that evaluates compression ratio, accuracy retention, latency, and throughput. A set of troubleshooting tips and sanity checks is provided to validate correctness.

While the current repository does not implement this entire system, these notes can guide future work on extreme compression of Agent Forge models.
