To split Python code files into meaningful chunks, you can use the `tree-sitter` library, which is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It can be used to parse source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST) and extract meaningful code blocks from it. Here's how you can use `tree-sitter` to achieve this:

1. Install the `tree-sitter` Python package:
```python
pip install tree-sitter
```

2. Install the `tree-sitter-python` language grammar:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python
```

3. Use `tree-sitter` to parse Python code files and extract meaningful code
   blocks:

```python
from tree_sitter import Language, Parser

# Set the path to the tree-sitter-python language grammar
TREE_SITTER_PYTHON_PATH = './tree-sitter-python'

# Build the Python language
Language.build_library(
    'build/my-languages.so',
    [TREE_SITTER_PYTHON_PATH]
)

PYTHON_LANGUAGE = Language('build/my-languages.so', 'python')

# Create a parser
parser = Parser()
parser.set_language(PYTHON_LANGUAGE)

# Parse the code
code = """
def foo():
    return "Hello, World!"

def bar():
    return "Goodbye, World!"
"""

tree = parser.parse(bytes(code, 'utf8'))

# Extract meaningful code blocks (e.g., function definitions)
def extract_functions(node):
    functions = []
    for child in node.children:
        if child.type == 'function_definition':
            start_byte = child.start_byte
            end_byte = child.end_byte
            functions.append(code[start_byte:end_byte])
        functions.extend(extract_functions(child))
    return functions

functions = extract_functions(tree.root_node)
print(functions)
```

In the example provided, the `tree-sitter` library is used to parse the Python
code into an abstract syntax tree (AST). The `extract_functions` function is
then used to recursively traverse the AST and extract code blocks corresponding
to function definitions. The extracted code blocks are stored in the `functions`
list.

The `extract_functions` function takes an AST node as input and returns a list
of code blocks corresponding to function definitions. It checks whether the
current node is of type `'function_definition'` (which corresponds to a function
definition in Python code). If it is, the function extracts the corresponding
code block from the original code using the `start_byte` and `end_byte`
attributes of the node. The function then recursively processes the children of
the current node to extract any nested function definitions.

The resulting list `functions` contains the extracted code blocks, each
representing a function definition from the original code. You can modify
the `extract_functions` function to extract other types of code blocks (e.g.,
class definitions, loops) by checking for different node types in the AST.

Once you have extracted the code blocks, you can proceed with further
processing, such as converting them into vectors and storing them in a vector
database, as mentioned in the previous response.

Note: The code provided in this response is a basic example to demonstrate the
concept. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to
extend or modify the code to handle more complex scenarios, such as handling
comments, docstrings, and other code constructs.
