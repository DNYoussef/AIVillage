## üêõ Bug Description
<!-- A clear and concise description of the bug -->

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Assessment
<!-- IMPORTANT: Consider security implications before reporting -->

### Potential Security Impact
- [ ] **No Security Impact** - Pure functionality bug
- [ ] **Low Security Risk** - Minor information disclosure
- [ ] **Medium Security Risk** - Potential for privilege escalation
- [ ] **High Security Risk** - Data exposure or system compromise
- [ ] **Unknown** - Needs security team evaluation

<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è If Medium/High security risk, consider using private security reporting instead -->
<!-- See SECURITY.md for responsible disclosure process -->

### Threat Modeling Quick Check
- [ ] **Authentication Bypass** - Does this affect login/access control?
- [ ] **Data Exposure** - Could this reveal sensitive information?
- [ ] **Injection Vector** - Could this lead to code/command injection?
- [ ] **Denial of Service** - Could this crash or overwhelm the system?
- [ ] **Cryptographic Issue** - Does this affect encryption/signatures?
- [ ] **Network Vulnerability** - Could this expose network communications?

```

### Configuration
```yaml
# Paste relevant configuration (remove sensitive data)
# Replace sensitive values with [REDACTED] or similar
```

### Screenshots/Recording

- [ ] Performance tests failing  
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline failing

## üîí Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- [ ] Does this involve user input that isn't properly validated?
- [ ] Could malicious input exploit this bug?
- [ ] Are there any injection possibilities?

### Access Control
- [ ] Does this affect user permissions or roles?
- [ ] Could this lead to unauthorized access?
- [ ] Are admin functions exposed inappropriately?

### Data Handling
- [ ] Does this involve sensitive data processing?
- [ ] Could this lead to data leakage?
- [ ] Are encryption/decryption operations affected?

### Network Security
- [ ] Does this affect network communications?
- [ ] Could this expose internal services?
- [ ] Are there man-in-the-middle attack vectors?

## üí° Possible Solution
<!-- If you have ideas on how to fix it -->

### Root Cause Hypothesis
<!-- What do you think is causing this issue? -->

### Suggested Approach
- [ ] **Code Fix** - Modify application logic
- [ ] **Configuration Change** - Update settings/parameters
- [ ] **Infrastructure Change** - Modify deployment/environment
- [ ] **Documentation Update** - Clarify usage/behavior
- [ ] **Security Patch** - Address security vulnerability

### Testing Approach
<!-- How should the fix be validated? -->
- [ ] Unit tests to cover the bug scenario
