## Execution Timeline

| Week | Phase | Deliverable | Verification |
|------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | HTX Transport | TLS/QUIC + Chrome mimicry | Wireshark indistinguishable from Chrome |
| 2 | HTX + Indistinguishability | Onion routing + cover traffic | Statistical analysis shows uniform distribution |
| 3 | Latency/Jitter | Active measurement + QoS | <500ms adaptation to link changes |
| 4 | SCION Gateway | Protocol implementation | Path verification passes |
| 5 | SCION + Multi-Agent | Full integration | 10-node consensus achieved |
| 6 | Final Integration | All axes complete | Bounty requirements met |

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install aioquic cryptography py-libp2p zeroconf
pip install pynacl scionproto  # If available
```

### Rust Components
```bash
cd betanet-client
cargo build --release
```

### Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# Multi-node test environment
docker-compose up -d  # 10 node test cluster
pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

## Success Criteria

1. **HTX**: Wireshark cannot distinguish from real Chrome traffic
2. **SCION**: Successfully routes through 3+ ASes with path validation
3. **Indistinguishability**: Cover traffic maintains 40% overhead maximum
4. **Latency**: 500ms link change detection and adaptation achieved
5. **Multi-Agent**: 10 agents coordinate with Byzantine fault tolerance

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SCION complexity | Start with simplified path selection |
| Chrome detection | Use real Chrome TLS library if needed |
| Battery drain | Adaptive cover traffic based on power |
| Latency overhead | Parallel processing and caching |
| Agent consensus | Start with trusted environment, add Byzantine later |
