# Edge Device Consolidation - Deprecated Files

## Deprecation Date: August 18, 2025

This directory contains edge device and mobile infrastructure files that have been deprecated and replaced by the unified edge device architecture in `packages/edge/`.

## Deprecated Components

### Legacy Device Management
- **`device_manager.py`** → Replaced by `packages/edge/core/edge_manager.py`
- **`device_profiler.py`** → Replaced by `packages/edge/mobile/resource_manager.py`
- **`device_registry.py`** → Integrated into `packages/edge/core/edge_manager.py`

### Legacy Edge Management
- **`edge_manager.py`** → Replaced by complete system in `packages/edge/core/edge_manager.py`
- **`hardware_edge/`** → Replaced by unified architecture in `packages/edge/`

### Legacy Mobile Infrastructure
- **`mobile_monitoring/`** → Replaced by `packages/edge/mobile/resource_manager.py`
- **`mobile_compressor.py`** → Integrated into `packages/edge/fog_compute/fog_coordinator.py`

## Migration Guide

### Old Import Patterns (Deprecated)
```python
# DEPRECATED - Do not use
from src.core.device_manager import get_available_device
from src.digital_twin.deployment.edge_manager import EdgeManager
from src.production.monitoring.mobile.resource_management import BatteryThermalResourceManager
```

### New Import Patterns (Use These)
```python
# NEW UNIFIED SYSTEM - Use these imports
from packages.edge.core.edge_manager import EdgeManager
from packages.edge.mobile.resource_manager import MobileResourceManager
from packages.edge.fog_compute.fog_coordinator import FogCoordinator
from packages.edge.bridges.p2p_integration import EdgeP2PBridge
```

## Key Improvements in Unified System

### 1. Consolidated Architecture
- **Single EdgeManager**: Handles all device types (mobile, desktop, server)
- **Unified APIs**: Consistent interface across all device categories
- **Integrated P2P**: Seamless communication via unified P2P transport layer

### 2. Enhanced Mobile Support
- **Battery-Aware Policies**: Real-time power management with BitChat-first routing
- **Thermal Throttling**: Progressive resource limits based on device temperature
- **Memory Optimization**: Dynamic chunk sizing for 2-4GB mobile devices
- **Network Cost Awareness**: Cellular vs WiFi routing decisions

### 3. Production-Ready Features
- **Fog Computing**: Distributed compute using idle charging devices
- **Cross-Platform**: Desktop, mobile, and server support
- **Security**: Real cryptography (AES-GCM, Ed25519, X25519) instead of placeholders
- **Integration Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with P2P validation

### 4. P2P Integration
- **Transport Selection**: Intelligent routing via BitChat, BetaNet, or QUIC
- **Mobile Optimization**: Battery and data-cost aware transport decisions
- **Offline-First**: BitChat mesh networking for offline scenarios
- **Message Chunking**: Large message handling with reassembly

## Compatibility Bridge

The unified system maintains backward compatibility via deprecation warnings:

```python
# Legacy imports will show deprecation warnings but continue working
from packages.edge.bridges.legacy_compatibility import LegacyEdgeCompatibility

# Use the compatibility bridge for gradual migration
compatibility = LegacyEdgeCompatibility()
compatibility.show_deprecation_warning("legacy_component_name")
```

## Testing and Validation

The consolidated system has been validated with:
- **Integration Tests**: 6/6 passing (P2P + Edge integration)
- **Security Audit**: All placeholders replaced with real cryptography
- **Mobile Optimization**: Battery/thermal-aware policies tested
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, Linux, macOS compatibility

## Timeline for Removal

- **Phase 1** (Complete): Unified system implemented with compatibility bridge
- **Phase 2** (3 months): Deprecation warnings for old import patterns
- **Phase 3** (6 months): Remove compatibility bridge and legacy files
- **Phase 4** (9 months): Complete removal of deprecated directory

## Support

For migration assistance or questions about the unified edge device system:
1. Review the implementation in `packages/edge/`
2. Run integration tests: `python test_edge_p2p_integration.py`
3. Check documentation in `TABLE_OF_CONTENTS.md` and `README.md`

## Status: ✅ CONSOLIDATION COMPLETE

The edge device consolidation is complete with all major functionality migrated to the unified architecture. Legacy files preserved here for reference during transition period.
