# AIVillage Documentation Remediation Plan

## Priority 1: Critical Fixes (Do Immediately)

### 1.1 Fix README.md Misleading Claims
- [ ] **Fix**: Remove "self-evolving" from main description
  - Current: "AI Village is an experimental multi-agent platform that explores self-evolving architectures"
  - Should be: "AI Village is an experimental multi-agent platform exploring autonomous agent architectures"
  - Justification: SelfEvolvingSystem is a stub (agents/unified_base_agent.py:791)

### 1.2 Add Development Status Warning
- [ ] **Fix**: Add clear development status to README.md
  - Add after line 4: "> ⚠️ **Development Status**: This is an experimental prototype. Many documented features are planned but not yet implemented. See [Implementation Status](#implementation-status) for details."
  - Justification: Multiple core features are stubs or incomplete

### 1.3 Update Feature Matrix with Accurate Status
- [ ] **Fix**: Update docs/reference/feature_matrix_1.md with real implementation status
  ```markdown
  | Feature | Status | Notes |
  | ------- | ------ | ----- |
  | Self-Evolving System | 🔴 Planned | Stub implementation only, no actual evolution |
  | King Agent | 🟡 Prototype | Basic coordination, limited functionality |
  | Sage Agent | 🟡 Prototype | RAG wrapper, research features incomplete |
  | Magi Agent | 🟡 Prototype | Basic code generation, minimal specialization |
  | Quiet-STaR | 🟡 Prototype | Implemented but not integrated with agents |
  | HippoRAG | 🔴 Planned | Not implemented, only mentioned in docs |
  ```
  - Justification: Current matrix shows checkmarks for non-functional features

### 1.4 Correct Agent Capability Claims
- [ ] **Fix**: Update AI_VILLAGE_EXPANSION_PLAN.md to reflect reality
  - Current: "Magi Agent: Successfully created and operational"
  - Should be: "Magi Agent: Basic prototype created, full specialization pending"
  - Justification: Magi agent has minimal actual specialization (agents/magi/magi_agent.py)

## Priority 2: Missing Documentation (Do This Week)

### 2.1 Document Compression Pipeline
- [ ] **Create**: docs/COMPRESSION_PIPELINE_GUIDE.md
  - Location: New file in docs/
  - Content:
    ```markdown
    # Compression Pipeline Guide

    ## Overview
    AIVillage includes a production-ready compression pipeline featuring:
    - SeedLM progressive encoding (4-8x compression)
    - BitNet ternary quantization
    - VPTQ vector quantization
    - Complete CLI interface

    ## Usage
    ```bash
    python agent_forge/compression/compress_model.py \
      --model-path ./models/base_model \
      --output-path ./models/compressed \
      --method seedlm \
      --compression-level 0.8
    ```
    ```
  - Code ref: agent_forge/compression/seedlm.py

### 2.2 Document Evolution System
- [ ] **Create**: docs/EVOLUTION_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md
  - Location: New file in docs/
  - Content: Document the working EvoMerge pipeline
  - Code ref: agent_forge/evomerge/evolutionary_tournament.py

### 2.3 Document Agent Forge Pipeline
- [ ] **Update**: Expand docs/README_AGENT_FORGE.md with actual capabilities
  - Add section on what actually works vs planned features
  - Include realistic examples
  - Code ref: agent_forge/forge_orchestrator.py

### 2.4 Create Implementation Status Page
- [ ] **Create**: docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
  - Comprehensive list of all features with honest status
  - Links to relevant code or tracking issues
  - Expected timelines for planned features

## Priority 3: Enhancements (Do This Month)

### 3.1 Simplify Architecture Documentation
- [ ] **Update**: docs/architecture.md
  - Remove mentions of unimplemented components
  - Create separate "Future Architecture" section
  - Add diagram of actual current architecture

### 3.2 Create Honest Getting Started Guide
- [ ] **Create**: docs/GETTING_STARTED_REALITY.md
  - What actually works today
  - How to use working features
  - Clear warnings about incomplete features

### 3.3 Add Development Roadmap
- [ ] **Update**: docs/roadmap.md
  - Realistic timelines based on current progress
  - Dependencies between features
  - Resource requirements

### 3.4 Document Working Examples
- [ ] **Create**: examples/working_examples/
  - Compression pipeline example
  - Evolution system example
  - Basic RAG pipeline example
  - Remove or mark non-working examples

## Technical Recommendations

### Code Quality Improvements

1. **Remove Stub Methods**
   - Current state: Placeholder methods that log but don't function
   - Suggested change: Either implement or remove with clear TODO
   - Benefits: Prevents confusion about capabilities
   - Implementation:
     ```python
     # Instead of:
     def evolve(self):
         self.logger.info("Evolving...")
         # Does nothing

     # Use:
     def evolve(self):
         raise NotImplementedError(
             "Evolution not yet implemented. "
             "See issue #123 for progress."
         )
     ```

2. **Consolidate Agent Implementations**
   - Current state: Three agents with minimal differentiation
   - Suggested change: Create single configurable agent class
   - Benefits: Reduce code duplication, easier maintenance
   - Implementation: Refactor to strategy pattern

3. **Simplify Import Structure**
   - Current state: Deep circular dependencies
   - Suggested change: Flatten structure, clear interfaces
   - Benefits: Easier to understand and maintain
   - Implementation: Create clear API boundaries

### Documentation Standards

1. **Adopt "Documentation Honesty" Policy**
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name

   **Status**: 🟡 Prototype / 🔴 Planned / ✅ Production
   **Completeness**: 40% (what works, what doesn't)
   **Dependencies**: List what needs to be built first
   **Timeline**: Realistic estimate or "No current timeline"
   ```

2. **Version Documentation**
   - Tag documentation with implementation version
   - Separate "current" vs "planned" features
   - Include migration guides between versions

3. **Add Code-to-Doc Validation**
   ```python
   # scripts/validate_docs.py
   """
   Validates documentation claims against actual code.
   Fails CI if significant mismatches found.
   """
   ```

## Suggested README.md Rewrite

```markdown
# AI Village - Experimental Multi-Agent AI Platform

> ⚠️ **Development Status**: Experimental prototype. See [Implementation Status](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) for feature availability.

## What Works Today

### ✅ Production-Ready
- **Compression Pipeline**: State-of-art model compression (SeedLM, BitNet, VPTQ)
- **Evolution System**: Evolutionary model merging with tournament selection
- **Basic RAG**: Functional retrieval-augmented generation

### 🟡 Prototype
- **Agent System**: Basic King, Sage, and Magi agents with limited functionality
- **Microservices**: Development-only Gateway and Twin services
- **Agent Forge**: Training pipeline for agent creation

### 🔴 Planned
- **Self-Evolution**: Autonomous agent improvement
- **HippoRAG**: Advanced retrieval system
- **Expert Vectors**: Specialized knowledge encoding
- **Production Deployment**: Hardened microservices

## Quick Start (What Actually Works)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run compression pipeline
python -m agent_forge.compression.compress_model --help

# 3. Start dev server (not for production!)
AIVILLAGE_DEV_MODE=true python server.py
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1**: Update all documentation to reflect reality
2. **Week 2**: Remove or fix stub implementations
3. **Week 3**: Document working features properly
4. **Week 4**: Create realistic roadmap and timeline

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Zero false claims in documentation
- [ ] All working features properly documented
- [ ] Clear distinction between working/prototype/planned
- [ ] Realistic roadmap with dependencies
- [ ] New users can understand actual capabilities

## Notes

- This plan prioritizes honesty over marketing
- Better to under-promise and over-deliver
- Clear documentation prevents user frustration
- Builds trust for long-term success
