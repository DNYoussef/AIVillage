2. **Enhance Testing Infrastructure**: Automated testing for experimental components
3. **Create Production Integration Framework**: Standardized approach for component graduation

## Conclusion

The AIVillage experimental components show strong potential for production deployment. The self-evolution system is particularly mature and ready for production alpha graduation. With focused effort on resolving import issues and completing security reviews, 60% of experimental components can successfully graduate within the next 16 weeks.

The main blocking issues are technical (import dependencies) rather than architectural, indicating that the experimental development has followed good design principles. Investment in resolving these issues will yield significant business value through enhanced system capabilities.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with graduated deployment following the proposed timeline, with self-evolution system as the pilot component for the graduation process.
