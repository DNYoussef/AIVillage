# Branching Strategy

This document outlines the branching strategy for our project's version control using Git.

## Main Branches

1. `main`: The main branch contains the stable, production-ready code. All releases are made from this branch.

2. `develop`: This is the integration branch for feature development. All feature branches are merged into this branch.

## Supporting Branches

3. `feature/*`: Feature branches are used for developing new features or enhancements. They are branched off from `develop` and merged back into `develop` when complete.

4. `refactor`: This branch is used for major refactoring efforts that span multiple features or components. It is branched off from `develop` and merged back when the refactoring is complete.

5. `hotfix/*`: Hotfix branches are used for critical bug fixes that need to be applied to the production code. They are branched off from `main` and merged into both `main` and `develop`.

6. `release/*`: Release branches are created from `develop` when preparing a new production release. They allow for last-minute bug fixes and version number updates before merging into `main` and tagging the release.

## Workflow

1. For new features:
   - Create a new `feature/` branch from `develop`
   - Develop and test the feature
   - Create a pull request to merge back into `develop`

2. For refactoring:
   - Use the `refactor` branch for major refactoring efforts
   - Merge completed refactoring work into `develop`

3. For releases:
   - Create a `release/` branch from `develop`
   - Perform final testing and version updates
   - Merge into `main` and tag the release
   - Merge back into `develop`

4. For critical bug fixes:
   - Create a `hotfix/` branch from `main`
   - Fix the bug and increment the patch version
   - Merge into `main` and tag the release
   - Merge into `develop`

By following this branching strategy, we can maintain a clean and organized codebase, facilitate collaborative development, and ensure stable releases.
