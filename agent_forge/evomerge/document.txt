EvoMerge: Evolutionary Model Merging System

1. Overview:
EvoMerge is an advanced system designed to merge multiple language models using evolutionary algorithms. It starts with initial models, creates a population of merged models, and uses tournament selection to evolve towards a single, optimized final model. The system now includes parallel processing for improved performance, enhanced visualization capabilities, and a more robust logging system.

2. System Components:
   a. Configuration (config.py)
   b. Model Merger (merger.py)
   c. Evolutionary Tournament (evolutionary_tournament.py)
   d. Model Loading (model_loading.py)
   e. Evaluation (evaluation.py)
   f. Merge Techniques (merge_techniques.py)
   g. Multi-Objective Optimization (multi_objective.py)
   h. Instruction Tuning (instruction_tuning.py)
   i. Cross-Domain Merging (cross_domain.py)
   j. Utility Functions (utils.py)
   k. GGUF Utilities (gguf_utils.py)
   l. Integration Tests (integration_tests.py)
   m. Performance Benchmarks (benchmarks.py)
   n. Command-line Interface (cli.py)
   o. Visualization (visualization.py)
   p. Logging Configuration (logging_config.py)
   q. Weight Masking Utilities (mask_weights_utils.py)
   r. Task Vector Operations (task_vector.py)

3. How the System Works:
   a. Initial Setup:
      - Define the configuration using the Configuration class in config.py.
      - Specify the initial models using ModelReference objects.

   b. Creating the Initial Population:
      - The EvolutionaryTournament class creates the initial population of merged models.
      - It uses different combinations of merge techniques to create diverse merged models.

   c. Evolutionary Process:
      - The evolve() method runs the evolutionary algorithm.
      - For each generation:
        i. Evaluate all models in the population using parallel processing for improved performance.
        ii. Select top performers using tournament selection.
        iii. Create new population through mutation and merging of lower performers.
      - This process continues for a specified number of generations or until early stopping criteria are met.

   d. Final Model Selection:
      - After the evolutionary process, the best-performing model is selected as the final output.

4. Key Features:

   l. Weight masking capabilities for model pruning and optimization
   m. Task vector operations for efficient model merging and fine-tuning

5. CLI Usage:
   To use the EvoMerge system via the command-line interface, you can use the following command:

   python -m agent_forge.evomerge.cli --download-and-merge --model1 <model1_path> --model2 <model2_path> --model3 <model3_path> --use-cli --verbose

   Example:
   python -m agent_forge.evomerge.cli --download-and-merge --model1 Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct --model2 Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct --model3 Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct --use-cli --verbose

   Options:
   --download-and-merge: Initiates the download and merging process
   --model1, --model2, --model3: Specify the paths or Hugging Face model IDs for the models to merge
   --use-cli: Use the Hugging Face CLI to download models (recommended for the latest versions)
   --verbose: Enable detailed logging output

6. Installation:
   To install EvoMerge and its dependencies, run:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

7. Running Tests:
   To run the unit tests:
   python -m unittest agent_forge.evomerge.test_evomerge

   To run the integration tests:
   python -m unittest agent_forge.evomerge.integration_tests

8. Benchmarking:
    To run performance benchmarks:
   python -m agent_forge.evomerge.benchmarks

9. Visualization:
   The system automatically generates visualizations during the evolutionary process and benchmarking. These include:
   - Fitness progression over generations (fitness_plot.png)
   - Benchmark comparisons between models (benchmark_comparison.png)
   - HTML report with detailed results (benchmark_report.html)

   11. Testing:
    a. Unit Tests (test_evomerge.py):
       ```
       python -m unittest test_evomerge.py
       ```
    b. Integration Tests (integration_tests.py):
       ```
       python -m unittest integration_tests.py
       ```

12. Logging:
    - Configurable logging with file rotation (logging_config.py)
    - Logs are saved to 'evomerge.log' by default
    - Use the --verbose flag in CLI commands for more detailed console output

13. GPU Support:
    - Automatic GPU detection and utilization when available
    - To check GPU usage:
      ```
      python -m agent_forge.evomerge.benchmarks
      ```

14. Error Handling:
    - Custom EvoMergeException for specific error scenarios
    - Detailed error messages are logged for debugging

15. Using Hugging Face Model Links:
    The CLI supports direct input of Hugging Face model links for the initial models:
    
    a. Specify models using their Hugging Face model IDs:
       ```
       python -m agent_forge.evomerge.cli --run --model1 bert-base-uncased --model2 roberta-base --model3 distilbert-base-uncased
       ```

    b. Mix and match Hugging Face model IDs with local paths:
       ```
       python -m agent_forge.evomerge.cli --run --model1 bert-base-uncased --model2 /path/to/local/model --model3 distilbert-base-uncased
       ```

    c. If fewer than three models are specified, the system will use default models to fill in the gaps.

    d. The CLI now includes a --use-cli flag to download models using the Hugging Face CLI before merging. This can be useful for ensuring the latest versions of the models are used and to avoid potential issues with the Transformers library's automatic downloading.

    e. On Windows systems, you may encounter permissions issues related to symlink creation when using the Hugging Face CLI. To resolve this, you can either:
       - Enable Developer Mode (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development)
       - Run the script as an administrator
       - Disable symlink creation by setting the environment variable HF_HUB_DISABLE_SYMLINKS_WARNING to any value before running the CLI command

16. GGUF Utilities:
    - The gguf_utils.py module provides functions for reading and writing GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) files.
    - These utilities can be used for advanced model manipulation and storage optimization.


17. Advanced Usage:
    [Previous content remains the same, add the following:]
    - Utilize weight masking techniques by importing functions from mask_weights_utils.py
    - Implement task vector operations for advanced model merging strategies using the TaskVector class in task_vector.py

18. Weight Masking:
    - The mask_weights_utils.py module provides functions for applying weight masks to model parameters.
    - Use the mask_input_with_mask_rate function to apply masks based on different strategies (random or magnitude-based).
    - Weight masking can be used for model pruning and optimization.

19. Task Vector Operations:
    - The task_vector.py module introduces the TaskVector class for efficient model merging and fine-tuning.
    - TaskVector objects can be created from pretrained and finetuned models or directly from parameter dictionaries.
    - Use TaskVector operations to combine multiple models or apply task-specific adaptations.
