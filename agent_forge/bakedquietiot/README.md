This directory contains the implementation of advanced machine learning techniques that combine Quiet-STaR (Quiet Self-Taught Reasoning), IoT (Intelligence of Things) framework, and deep system baking for enhanced reasoning capabilities.

## Overview

The `bakedquietiot` module implements cutting-edge AI reasoning techniques that enable models to generate explicit internal thoughts, apply multiple cognitive strategies, and iteratively refine their reasoning processes. These techniques represent the forefront of AI research in metacognitive reasoning and self-improving systems.

- **Iterative Refinement:** Self-critique and revision cycles
- **Ethical Evaluation:** Built-in ethical consideration framework
- **Neural Mixing:** Hidden state combination for thought integration

### `deepbaking.py` - Deep System Baking
**Purpose:** Advanced prompt baking system that embeds reasoning frameworks directly into model weights through iterative training.

## Quiet-STaR Implementation

### Core Architecture

#### TalkHead Module
```python
class TalkHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.dense = nn.Linear(hidden_size * 2, 1)
        self.activation = nn.Sigmoid()
```

**Purpose:** Neural module for mixing base model outputs with thought-generated representations.

**Functionality:**
- Takes concatenated hidden states from base and thought generations
- Outputs mixing weights via sigmoid activation
- Enables dynamic blending of reasoning modes

#### Cognitive Strategies Framework

The system implements six core cognitive strategies:

1. **Systems Thinking:** Holistic view with leverage point identification
2. **First Principles:** Fundamental assumption challenging
3. **Cross Domain:** Pattern recognition across fields
4. **Probabilistic Thinking:** Uncertainty quantification and simulation
5. **Rapid Iteration:** Quick prototyping and optimization
6. **Paradox Resolution:** Higher-order contradiction resolution

### Reasoning Process

#### IoT (Intelligence of Things) Cycle
```python
async def iot_process(self, input_text, max_iterations=5):
    thought = {"text": input_text, "hidden_states": None}
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        thought = await self.generate_thought(thought["text"])
        insights = await self.extract_strategy_insights(thought["text"])
        critique = await self.generate_critique(thought["text"], insights)
        alternatives = await self.generate_alternatives(thought["text"], insights)
        evaluation = await self.self_evaluate(thought["text"], insights)
        thought = await self.revise(thought, critique, alternatives, evaluation, insights)

        if "<ready to answer>" in thought["text"]:
            break
    return thought, insights
```

**Process Steps:**
1. **Initial Thought Generation:** Apply cognitive strategies to input
2. **Strategy Insight Extraction:** Parse insights from each cognitive strategy
3. **Critique Generation:** Self-critique with low temperature (0.2)
4. **Alternative Generation:** Explore alternatives with high temperature (0.8)
5. **Self-Evaluation:** Comprehensive evaluation including ethical considerations
6. **Revision:** Synthesize critique, alternatives, and evaluation into improved thought
7. **Convergence Check:** Continue until "<ready to answer>" signal

#### Ethical Evaluation Framework

Built-in ethical assessment covering:
- **Bias and Fairness:** Unbiased outcome promotion
- **Privacy Protection:** Data protection considerations
- **Transparency:** Explainability requirements
- **Consequence Analysis:** Negative impact assessment
- **Truth Alignment:** Reality correspondence verification

### Neural Integration

#### Hidden State Mixing
```python
async def mix_thought_with_base_output(self, base_output, thought):
    base_hidden = base_output["hidden_states"][-1][-1]
    thought_hidden = thought["hidden_states"][-1][-1]

    combined_hidden = torch.cat([base_hidden, thought_hidden], dim=-1)
    mixing_weights = self.talk_head(combined_hidden)

    mixed_hidden = (1 - mixing_weights) * base_hidden + mixing_weights * thought_hidden
```

**Process:**
1. Extract final hidden states from base and thought generations
2. Concatenate hidden representations
3. Generate mixing weights via TalkHead module
4. Compute weighted average of hidden states
5. Generate final output from mixed representation

## Deep System Baking

### Baking Architecture

#### Special Token Framework
The system uses an extensive vocabulary of 30+ special tokens for structured reasoning:

**Thought Structure Tokens:**
- `<start of thought>`, `<end of thought>`
- `<initial thought>`, `<refined thought>`
- `<alternative perspective>`, `<key insight>`

**Process Control Tokens:**
- `<analyze>`, `<plan>`, `<execute>`, `<evaluate>`, `<revise>`
- `<continue thinking>`, `<ready to answer>`

**Cognitive Strategy Tokens:**
- `<systems_thinking>`, `<first_principles>`, `<cross_domain>`
- `<probabilistic_thinking>`, `<rapid_iteration>`, `<paradox_resolution>`

#### Baking Process

```python
async def deep_bake_system(self, max_iterations=50, consistency_threshold=0.95):
    system_prompt = """[Comprehensive reasoning framework]"""

    for i in range(max_iterations):
        await self.bake(system_prompt)
        consistency = await self.evaluate_consistency()
        if consistency >= consistency_threshold:
            break
```

**Steps:**
1. **System Prompt Definition:** Comprehensive reasoning framework specification
2. **Iterative Baking:** Gradient-based embedding of reasoning patterns
3. **Consistency Evaluation:** Automated assessment of framework adherence
4. **Convergence Detection:** Training until consistency threshold achieved
5. **Model Saving:** Preserve baked reasoning capabilities

#### Consistency Evaluation

```python
async def score_response(self, response):
    expected_structure = self.special_tokens
    score = 0

    # Token presence scoring
    for token in expected_structure:
        if token in response:
            score += 1

    # Sequential order scoring
    last_index = -1
    for token in expected_structure:
        index = response.find(token)
        if index != -1 and index > last_index:
            score += 1
            last_index = index

    return score / (2 * len(expected_structure))
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- **Token Presence:** All expected reasoning tokens appear
- **Sequential Order:** Tokens appear in logical reasoning sequence
- **Normalized Scoring:** 0-1 scale for consistency measurement

## Advanced Features

### Geometry-Aware Prompting

Integration with geometric analysis for context-aware reasoning:
```python
prompt = f"<geom id={ID_nl:.2f} t={temperature:.2f}/>{task_text}"
```

**Benefits:**
- Context-sensitive reasoning based on model's geometric state
- Dynamic temperature adjustment based on intrinsic dimensionality
- Geometric conditioning for optimal reasoning performance

### Quality Assessment

#### Insight Quality Scoring
```python
async def evaluate_insight_quality(self, insights):
    quality_scores = {}
    for strategy, insight in insights.items():
        score = min(10, len(insight) / 20)  # Length-based scoring
        keywords = ["analyze", "consider", "evaluate", "integrate", "optimize"]
        score += sum(2 for keyword in keywords if keyword in insight.lower())
        quality_scores[strategy] = min(10, score) / 10
    return quality_scores
```

**Metrics:**
- **Length-based Assessment:** Detailed insights score higher
- **Keyword Analysis:** Presence of analytical terms
- **Strategy-specific Scoring:** Individual cognitive strategy evaluation
