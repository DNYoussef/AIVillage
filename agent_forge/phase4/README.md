# Phase 4: Advanced Integration

This directory implements Phase 4 of the Agent Forge training pipeline, focusing on prompt baking, tool integration, and ADAS (Adaptive Architecture Search) optimization.

## Overview

Phase 4 represents the advanced integration stage where successful training patterns are baked into model weights, external tools are connected, and automated architecture search optimizes the model structure. This phase transforms the self-aware model from Phase 3 into a production-ready agent.

## Components

### `adas.py`
**Purpose:** Simple wrapper for ADAS (Adaptive Architecture Search) integration that optimizes agent architecture through meta-model evaluation.

**Key Features:**
- **Architecture Optimization:** Uses meta-model evaluation to propose and test architectural improvements
- **Automated Refinement:** Iteratively improves model structure until performance plateaus
- **Integration Wrapper:** Provides clean interface to the ADAS system

### `prompt_bake.py`
**Purpose:** Implements prompt baking functionality to embed effective reasoning strategies directly into model weights.

**Key Features:**
- **Strategy Embedding:** Converts successful prompt patterns into weight modifications
- **Reasoning Consolidation:** Bakes effective reasoning traces into permanent model knowledge
- **Performance Optimization:** Reduces inference time by eliminating repetitive prompting

## ADAS Integration

### Function: `adas(model_path: str) -> str`

**Purpose:** Optimize agent architecture using the ADAS meta-evaluation system.

**Process:**
1. **Initialize ADASystem:** Creates meta-model for architecture evaluation
2. **Optimization Loop:** Iteratively proposes and evaluates architectural changes
3. **Convergence Detection:** Continues until performance improvements plateau
4. **Return Optimized Path:** Provides path to optimized model architecture

**Usage:**
```python
from agent_forge.phase4.adas import adas

# Optimize architecture for self-aware model from Phase 3
optimized_path = adas("path/to/phase3_model.pt")
print(f"Optimized model saved to: {optimized_path}")
```

## Prompt Baking Integration

The prompt baking system (detailed implementation in `agent_forge/prompt_baking/`) is integrated in Phase 4 to:

1. **Analyze Successful Patterns:** Identify effective reasoning strategies from Phase 3 training
2. **Extract Key Prompts:** Isolate prompt patterns that consistently lead to correct reasoning
3. **Weight Integration:** Bake these patterns directly into model parameters
4. **Validation Testing:** Ensure baked strategies maintain effectiveness

## Integration Points

### Input from Phase 3
- **Self-Aware Model:** Model capable of internal state prediction and self-modeling
- **Geometric Understanding:** Advanced geometric monitoring and grokking detection
- **Training Patterns:** Collected successful reasoning traces and patterns

### Phase 4 Objectives
1. **Prompt Baking:** Embed effective reasoning strategies into weights
2. **Tool Integration:** Connect to external tools and RAG system
3. **ADAS Optimization:** Meta-model driven architecture improvements
4. **Performance Consolidation:** Optimize for production deployment

### Output to Phase 5
- **Optimized Architecture:** ADAS-improved model structure
- **Baked Strategies:** Reasoning patterns embedded in weights
- **Tool-Connected Agent:** Ready for external system integration
- **Production Model:** Optimized for deployment and monitoring

## Tool & Memory Integration

Phase 4 connects the agent to:

### External Tools
- **RAG System:** Persistent knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Memory Banks:** Long-term experience storage
- **Communication APIs:** Inter-agent messaging protocols
- **Monitoring Systems:** Performance tracking and logging

## Configuration and Setup

### ADAS Configuration
The ADAS system requires:
- **Meta-Model Path:** Pre-trained architecture evaluation model
- **Optimization Targets:** Performance metrics for improvement
- **Resource Constraints:** Computational limits for architecture search
- **Convergence Criteria:** When to stop optimization

### Prompt Baking Setup
- **Pattern Database:** Collection of successful reasoning traces
- **Baking Targets:** Specific model layers for strategy embedding
- **Validation Sets:** Test data for strategy effectiveness
- **Integration Weights:** Balance between baked and dynamic strategies

## Usage Workflow

### Complete Phase 4 Pipeline
```python
from agent_forge.phase4.adas import adas
from agent_forge.prompt_baking.baker import PromptBaker
from agent_forge.tools import RAGIntegrator

# 1. Load self-aware model from Phase 3
model = load_model("phase3_output/self_aware_model.pt")

# 2. Perform prompt baking
baker = PromptBaker(model)
baked_model = baker.bake_reasoning_strategies(
    patterns=collected_patterns,
    target_layers=["transformer.h.8", "transformer.h.11"]
)

# 3. Integrate with external tools
rag_integrator = RAGIntegrator()
tool_connected_model = rag_integrator.connect(baked_model)

# 4. Apply ADAS optimization
optimized_path = adas(tool_connected_model.save_path)

# 5. Load optimized model for Phase 5
final_model = load_model(optimized_path)
```

## Performance Monitoring

Phase 4 includes comprehensive monitoring:

### Metrics Tracked
- **Reasoning Efficiency:** Reduction in prompt overhead after baking
- **Architecture Performance:** Improvement from ADAS optimization
- **Tool Integration Speed:** Latency for external system access
- **Memory Utilization:** Resource usage patterns

### Logging Integration
```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("AF-Phase4")

# Track ADAS optimization progress
logger.info(f"ADAS optimization cycle {cycle}: {performance_metric}")

# Monitor prompt baking effectiveness
logger.info(f"Baked {num_strategies} strategies, efficiency gain: {gain}%")
```

## Research Foundation

Phase 4 builds on:
- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS):** Automated architecture optimization
