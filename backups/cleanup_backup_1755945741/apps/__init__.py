AIVillage Apps Layer - User-Facing Applications

This layer contains all user-facing applications and interfaces:
- mobile: React Native/Flutter mobile applications
- web: Web interfaces and dashboards
- cli: Command-line tools and utilities
- desktop: Desktop applications

All apps should depend only on the core business logic layer,
never directly on infrastructure components.
