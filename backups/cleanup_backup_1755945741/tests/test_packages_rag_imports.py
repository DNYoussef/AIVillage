"""
Test-driven development for packages.rag import structure.

This test should FAIL initially, demonstrating the missing packages.rag module structure
that prevents HyperRAG system from working properly.

Following London School TDD:
1. Write test that fails (missing imports)
2. Create minimal implementation to pass test
3. Verify real functionality works without mocks for core features
