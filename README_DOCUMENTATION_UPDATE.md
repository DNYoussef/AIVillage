## 🚀 Quick Start

### Production Components (Stable APIs)

```python
# Advanced model compression with 4-8x reduction
from production.compression.model_compression import CompressionPipeline
from production.compression.compression import Stage1Compression

# High-performance compression
pipeline = CompressionPipeline()
compressed_model = pipeline.compress(your_model, method='bitnet')

# Evolutionary model optimization and merging
from production.evolution.evomerge import EvolutionaryTournament, ModelMerger

tournament = EvolutionaryTournament()
merger = ModelMerger()
optimized_model = tournament.evolve_population(models)

# Production RAG system with advanced retrieval
from production.rag.rag_system import RAGPipeline, CognitiveNexus

rag = RAGPipeline()
cognitive_system = CognitiveNexus()
rag.index_documents(your_docs)
response = rag.generate_with_context("Your question")

# Geometric analysis of model weight spaces
from production.geometry.geometry import WeightSpaceAnalyzer

analyzer = WeightSpaceAnalyzer()
analysis = analyzer.analyze_model_geometry(model)
```

### Core Infrastructure

```python
# Agent deployment and orchestration
from agent_forge import AgentDeployer, ModelServer

deployer = AgentDeployer()
server = ModelServer()
deployer.deploy_model(model, "production")

# Mesh networking and decentralized communication
from communications import MeshCredits, MCPClient

credits = MeshCredits()
client = MCPClient()
credits.allocate_computational_resources(task)
```

### Experimental Components (Development APIs)

```python
# Multi-agent orchestration system
from experimental.agents.agents.king import KingAgent
from experimental.agents.agents.sage import SageAgent
from experimental.agents.agents.magi import MagiAgent

# Strategic planning and decision making
king = KingAgent()
sage = SageAgent()
magi = MagiAgent()

# Microservices architecture
from experimental.services.services.gateway import GatewayService
from experimental.services.services.twin import TwinService

gateway = GatewayService()
twin = TwinService()
```
