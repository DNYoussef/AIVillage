## SPECIALIZATIONS
- Blue-green deployment strategies
- Rollback and recovery procedures
- Phased service rollout coordination
- Service integration orchestration
- Risk mitigation planning

## DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

### 1. Phased Rollout Plan

#### Phase 5.1: Graph Services (Week 1-2)
```yaml
GraphServices_Deployment:
  week_1:
    - Deploy GapDetectionService (Blue environment)
    - Run parallel validation against legacy GraphFixer
    - Performance monitoring and validation
    - Switch to Green environment if validated
    
  week_2:  
    - Deploy NodeProposalService (Blue environment)
    - Deploy RelationshipAnalyzer (Blue environment)
    - Integration testing between graph services
    - Full GraphFixer replacement validation
    - Production cutover with monitoring
```

#### Phase 5.2: Fog Services (Week 3-4)  
```yaml
FogServices_Deployment:
  week_3:
    - Deploy HarvestService (Blue environment)
    - Deploy TokenService (Blue environment)  
    - Parallel validation against legacy FogCoordinator
    - Resource allocation testing
    
  week_4:
    - Deploy MarketplaceService (Blue environment)
    - Deploy RoutingService (Blue environment)
    - End-to-end fog computing workflow testing
    - Production cutover with phased traffic migration
```

#### Phase 5.3: Network Services (Week 5-6)
```yaml  
NetworkServices_Deployment:
  week_5:
    - Deploy RouteSelectionService (Blue environment)
    - Deploy ProtocolManager (Blue environment)
    - Deploy NetworkMonitor (Blue environment)
    - Network routing validation testing
    
  week_6:
    - Deploy PathOptimizer (Blue environment) 
    - Deploy TopologyAnalyzer (Blue environment)
    - Deploy PolicyEngine (Blue environment)
    - Complete PathPolicy replacement validation
    - Production cutover with traffic shaping
```

#### Phase 5.4: Integration & Validation (Week 7-8)
```yaml
Integration_Validation:
  week_7:
    - Cross-service integration validation
    - End-to-end system testing
    - Performance benchmarking
    - Load testing under production conditions
    
  week_8:
    - Final production cutover
    - Legacy system decommissioning
    - Monitoring and optimization
    - Success criteria validation
```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment Architecture

#### Environment Configuration:
```yaml
BlueGreenSetup:
  blue_environment:
    - New microservices deployment
    - Parallel data processing
    - Independent monitoring
    - Isolated testing capabilities
    
  green_environment:  
    - Production traffic handling
    - Legacy system operation
    - Current monitoring systems
    - Stable service provision
    
  load_balancer:
    - Traffic routing control
    - Instant cutover capability  
    - Gradual traffic migration
    - Rollback switching
```

### 3. Rollback Procedures

#### Immediate Rollback Triggers:
- Performance degradation >5%
- Error rate increase >2%
- Service unavailability >30 seconds
- Coupling metrics regression
- Critical functionality failure

#### Rollback Process:
```python
class RollbackManager:
    def detect_rollback_condition(self) -> bool
    def initiate_immediate_rollback(self, reason: str) -> bool  
    def restore_legacy_services(self, service_group: str) -> bool
    def validate_rollback_success(self) -> ValidationResult
    def notify_stakeholders(self, status: RollbackStatus) -> None
```

### 4. Risk Mitigation

#### Risk Assessment Matrix:
| Risk Level | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| High | Service Downtime | Low | Blue-green deployment with instant rollback |
| Medium | Performance Degradation | Medium | Continuous monitoring with auto-rollback |
| Medium | Data Inconsistency | Low | Transaction rollback mechanisms |
| Low | Configuration Errors | High | Automated configuration validation |

#### Contingency Plans:
- **Service Failure**: Automatic failover to legacy systems
- **Performance Issues**: Traffic throttling and gradual rollback  
- **Integration Failures**: Service isolation and independent rollback
- **Data Corruption**: Point-in-time recovery procedures

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- Zero downtime deployment
- <5% performance impact during migration  
- Successful rollback capability demonstrated
- All services integrated successfully
- Legacy systems cleanly decommissioned

## COORDINATION PROTOCOLS
- Memory key: `swarm/migration/strategy`
- Status updates: Every 10 minutes during deployments
- Dependencies: ALL service extraction agents + Testing Coordinator
- Approvals: Performance validation required before cutover
- Communication: Real-time deployment status broadcasts
