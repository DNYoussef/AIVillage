## ADR-001: Complete Service Separation for Training Operations

### Status
**ACCEPTED** - Critical architectural correction

### Context

The existing training architecture incorrectly conflates two fundamentally different operations:

1. **Cognate Pretraining**: Creating 25M parameter foundation models from scratch using specialized algorithms
2. **Agent Training**: Task-specific fine-tuning and behavioral training for various agent architectures

This conflation causes:
- Algorithm mismatches (using GrokFast for fine-tuning)
- Resource contention between different workload types
- Architectural confusion and maintenance complexity
- Inability to optimize for specific use cases

### Decision

We will implement **complete service separation** between:
- **CognatePretrainingService**: Exclusively handles foundation model creation
- **AgentForgeTrainingService**: Handles all other training operations

### Rationale

**Technical Reasons:**
1. **Algorithm Specialization**: GrokFast optimization is specifically designed for pretraining, not fine-tuning
2. **Resource Requirements**: Pretraining needs different resource allocation patterns than fine-tuning
3. **Data Processing**: Mathematical reasoning datasets require different processing than task-specific data
4. **Model Lifecycle**: Foundation models and task-specific agents have different creation patterns

**Architectural Reasons:**
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear purpose
2. **Independent Scaling**: Services can scale based on different demands
3. **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one service don't affect the other
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use optimal technologies

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Optimal algorithms for each use case
- Independent resource allocation and scaling
- Better maintainability and testability
- Reduced complexity in each service

**Negative:**
- Additional service orchestration complexity
- Need for service communication protocols
- Potential code duplication for shared utilities

**Mitigation:**
- Well-defined service contracts
- Shared utility libraries for common functionality
- Service discovery and health monitoring

## ADR-002: GrokFast Optimization Exclusivity

### Status
**ACCEPTED** - Algorithm separation requirement

### Context

GrokFast is a specialized optimization algorithm designed for:
- Accelerating convergence during pretraining from random initialization
- Mathematical reasoning task optimization
- Large-scale parameter learning

It is **not appropriate** for:
- Fine-tuning pretrained models
- Small-scale task adaptation
- Behavioral training scenarios

### Decision

**GrokFast optimization will be exclusive to CognatePretrainingService.**

AgentForgeTrainingService will use standard optimizers (Adam, AdamW, etc.) appropriate for fine-tuning and agent training scenarios.

### Rationale

**Technical Evidence:**
1. GrokFast is designed for "grokking" phenomena in pretraining
2. Fine-tuning requires different learning dynamics
3. Agent training often needs exploration-friendly optimization
4. Task-specific training benefits from different learning rate schedules

**Performance Considerations:**
1. GrokFast may cause instability in fine-tuning scenarios
2. Standard optimizers are better validated for transfer learning
3. Different optimization landscapes require different approaches

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimal optimization for each training scenario
- Reduced risk of training instability
- Better convergence characteristics for each use case

**Negative:**
- Need to maintain different optimization codebases
- Cannot leverage GrokFast benefits for non-pretraining tasks

**Implementation:**
- CognatePretrainingService: Mandatory GrokFast with α=0.98, λ=2.0
- AgentForgeTrainingService: AdamW, Adam, SGD with appropriate schedulers
