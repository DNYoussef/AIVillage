# Subsystem Responsibility Mapping

## Current State: Monolithic Integration

The `DistributedFederatedLearning` class currently serves as a "God Object" that manages 7 distinct service domains within a single class. This analysis maps each subsystem's responsibilities and identifies clear service boundaries.

## Summary: Service Extraction Opportunities

| Service Domain | Current State | Lines | Coupling Level | Extraction Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Federated Learning Core | ✅ Appropriate | ~400 | Low | Keep as coordinator |
| Harvest Management | 🚨 Missing/Scattered | ~50 | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Marketplace/Orchestration | 🚨 Embedded | ~115 | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Privacy/Hidden Services | 🚨 Embedded | ~173 | High | **CRITICAL** |
| Tokenomics/Economics | 🚨 Scattered | ~30 | Medium | **HIGH** |
| P2P Network/Transport | 🚨 Embedded | ~80 | High | **HIGH** |
| Monitoring/Metrics | 🚨 Basic | ~20 | Low | **MEDIUM** |

## Conclusion

The current monolithic architecture violates the **Single Responsibility Principle** by mixing 7 distinct service domains. The federated learning coordinator should focus solely on ML training orchestration, while the other domains should be extracted into independent, loosely-coupled services with well-defined interfaces.

This refactoring would:
- ✅ Improve testability and maintainability
- ✅ Enable independent service scaling
- ✅ Reduce coupling and complexity
- ✅ Support better separation of concerns
- ✅ Allow specialized team ownership of each service
