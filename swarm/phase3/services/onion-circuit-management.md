# OnionCircuitService Extraction Complete

## Service Extraction Summary

Successfully extracted the `OnionCircuitService` from `fog_onion_coordinator.py` to create a dedicated circuit management service with the following architecture:

### Created Files
- `infrastructure/fog/privacy/onion_circuit_service.py` (165 lines)

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Circuit Pool Management per Privacy Level
- **PRIVATE**: 3 circuits (high demand)
- **CONFIDENTIAL**: 2 circuits (dedicated)
- **SECRET**: 2 circuits (isolated)
- **PUBLIC**: 1 circuit (minimal)

#### 2. Circuit Selection and Load Balancing
- Intelligent load balancing based on bytes transferred and request count
- Circuit health scoring with time-based decay
- Optimal circuit selection using load scoring algorithm

#### 3. Circuit Maintenance and Rotation  
- Background rotation every 5 minutes
- Circuit lifetime management (configurable, default 30 minutes)
- Automatic pool maintenance with target size enforcement
- Failed circuit detection and replacement

#### 4. Circuit Statistics and Metrics
- Per-circuit usage tracking (bytes sent/received, requests handled)
- Health scoring and performance metrics
- Service-level statistics with pool health averages
- Secure metrics cleanup for expired circuits

#### 5. Security Requirements
- Client authentication for circuit access
- Privacy level isolation (circuits cannot cross privacy boundaries)
- Secure circuit destruction on shutdown
- No information leakage in statistics

### Integration Changes

#### Modified `fog_onion_coordinator.py`:
1. **Import Integration**: Added OnionCircuitService and privacy level conversion
2. **Component Integration**: Replaced circuit pools with circuit service
3. **Authentication Flow**: Added client authentication for task and service access
4. **Usage Tracking**: Integrated circuit usage statistics updates
5. **Cleanup**: Removed redundant circuit pool management code

#### Key Integration Points:
- **Task Submission**: Uses circuit service for privacy-aware circuit allocation
- **Service Creation**: Authenticates services and allocates dedicated circuits
- **Gossip Protocol**: System-level authentication for private messaging
- **Statistics**: Integrated circuit service stats into coordinator reporting

### Security Architecture

#### Authentication Model
```python
# Simple token-based authentication
auth_token = f"auth_{client_id}_token"
circuit_service.authenticate_client(client_id, auth_token)
```

#### Privacy Level Conversion
```python
# Converts fog privacy levels to circuit service levels
def _convert_privacy_level(privacy_level: PrivacyLevel) -> CircuitPrivacyLevel:
    mapping = {
        PrivacyLevel.PUBLIC: CircuitPrivacyLevel.PUBLIC,
        PrivacyLevel.PRIVATE: CircuitPrivacyLevel.PRIVATE,
        PrivacyLevel.CONFIDENTIAL: CircuitPrivacyLevel.CONFIDENTIAL,
        PrivacyLevel.SECRET: CircuitPrivacyLevel.SECRET,
    }
```

### Performance Features

#### Load Balancing Algorithm
- Combines bytes transferred and request count
- Weighted scoring: `(total_bytes / 1024) + (requests * 10)`
- Selects circuit with lowest load score

#### Health Monitoring
- Time-based health decay: `1.0 - (age_minutes / 60)`
- Minimum health threshold: 0.1
- Average health calculation per privacy pool

#### Background Maintenance
- **Circuit Rotation**: Every 5 minutes
- **Pool Maintenance**: Every 2 minutes  
- **Metrics Cleanup**: Every 10 minutes

### Deployment Notes

1. **Service Lifecycle**: Automatically starts/stops with fog coordinator
2. **Circuit Pools**: Pre-initialized on service startup
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with fallback mechanisms
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired metrics and circuits

### Success Metrics

✅ **Circuit Pool Management**: Isolated pools per privacy level  
✅ **Load Balancing**: Intelligent circuit selection implemented  
✅ **Background Maintenance**: Automated rotation and cleanup  
✅ **Security Isolation**: Authentication and privacy boundaries enforced  
✅ **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics without information leakage  
✅ **Integration Complete**: Seamless integration with fog coordinator  

The OnionCircuitService provides a robust, secure, and efficient circuit management layer that maintains privacy boundaries while optimizing performance through intelligent load balancing and background maintenance.
