# Privacy Security Architecture - Fog Onion Coordinator Refactoring

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive privacy security architecture for refactoring the 637-line fog_onion_coordinator.py with a coupling score of 42.83. The design eliminates circular dependencies with FogCoordinator while implementing a robust 4-tier privacy system with enterprise-grade security controls.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Issues
- **Monolithic Design**: 637 lines in a single coordinator class
- **High Coupling**: 42.83 coupling score indicating tight interdependencies
- **Circular Dependencies**: Direct coupling with FogCoordinator
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Privacy, circuit management, and service hosting intermingled
- **Security Boundaries**: Unclear separation of privacy levels and access controls

### Privacy Requirements Identified
- **4 Privacy Levels**: PUBLIC, PRIVATE (3 hops), CONFIDENTIAL (5+ hops), SECRET (full anonymity)
- **Circuit Management**: Complex pools and load balancing
- **Hidden Service Integration**: Censorship-resistant hosting
- **Gossip Protocols**: Secure peer-to-peer communication
- **State Isolation**: Preventing information leakage between privacy levels

## Security-First Service Architecture

### 1. PrivacyTaskService (~135 lines)
**Primary Responsibility**: Privacy-aware task management with strict level enforcement

#### Security Design Principles
```python
class PrivacyTaskService:
    """
    Manages tasks with privacy level enforcement and security boundaries.
    
    Security Features:
    - Privacy level validation and enforcement
    - Task isolation by privacy tier
    - Secure state transitions
    - Authentication for task access
    - Audit logging of privacy operations
    """

2. **Context Isolation**: Tasks cannot access data from higher privacy levels
3. **Resource Limits**: Per-privacy-level resource quotas and rate limiting
4. **Secure Cleanup**: Cryptographic deletion of sensitive task data

#### Interface Security
```python
@dataclass
class SecureTaskContext:
    privacy_level: PrivacyLevel

    - Threat detection and mitigation
    """
```

## Eliminating Circular Dependencies

### Dependency Inversion Strategy
1. **Abstract Interfaces**: Define clear contracts between services
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Use events instead of direct method calls
3. **Dependency Injection**: Services receive dependencies rather than creating them
4. **Service Registry**: Central registry for service discovery without tight coupling
