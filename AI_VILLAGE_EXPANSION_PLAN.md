# AI Village Expansion Plan

## Current Status
âœ… **Magi Agent**: Successfully created and operational
- Specialization: Technical mastery (Python, Algorithms, Data Structures)
- Score: 0.8195
- Status: Ready for deployment

## Next Phase: King and Sage Agents

### King Agent - Strategic Coordinator
**Role**: Leadership and coordination of the AI Village

**Specialization Focus**:
- Strategic decision-making
- Multi-agent coordination
- Resource allocation
- Conflict resolution
- Goal prioritization

**Training Curriculum**:
```python
capabilities = {
    "strategic_planning": "Long-term goal setting and roadmap creation",
    "resource_management": "Optimal allocation of computational resources",
    "coordination": "Multi-agent task distribution and synchronization",
    "decision_making": "High-level choices and trade-off analysis",
    "leadership": "Guiding and motivating agent collective",
    "conflict_resolution": "Resolving inter-agent disagreements"
}
```

**Implementation Command**:
```bash
python -m agent_forge.training.create_specialized_agent \
    --agent-type king \
    --specialization strategic-coordinator \
    --capabilities strategic_planning,resource_management,coordination,decision_making,leadership,conflict_resolution \
    --levels 10 \
    --questions-per-level 1000 \
    --output-dir D:/AgentForge/king_agent
```

### Sage Agent - Knowledge Curator
**Role**: Research and knowledge synthesis for the AI Village

**Specialization Focus**:
- Information retrieval
- Knowledge synthesis
- Research methodology
- Pattern recognition
- Wisdom cultivation

**Training Curriculum**:
```python
capabilities = {
    "research_methodology": "Systematic investigation and analysis",
    "knowledge_synthesis": "Combining disparate information sources",
    "pattern_recognition": "Identifying trends and connections",
    "information_retrieval": "Efficient data location and extraction",
    "wisdom_cultivation": "Deep understanding and insight generation",
    "teaching": "Knowledge transfer to other agents"
}
```

**Implementation Command**:
```bash
python -m agent_forge.training.create_specialized_agent \
    --agent-type sage \
    --specialization knowledge-curator \
    --capabilities research_methodology,knowledge_synthesis,pattern_recognition,information_retrieval,wisdom_cultivation,teaching \
    --levels 10 \
    --questions-per-level 1000 \
    --output-dir D:/AgentForge/sage_agent
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Sequential Creation (Recommended)
Create agents one at a time to ensure stability and resource management.

**Timeline**:
1. **Day 1**: Create King agent (1-2 hours)
2. **Day 2**: Validate King, create Sage agent (1-2 hours)
3. **Day 3**: Integration testing of all three agents

**Advantages**:
- Lower resource requirements
- Easier debugging
- Progressive validation

### Phase 2: Village Integration
Once all agents are created, implement the coordination layer.

**Components**:
1. **Communication Protocol**: Inter-agent messaging system
2. **Task Router**: Directs queries to appropriate agent
3. **Consensus Mechanism**: For multi-agent decisions
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Shared context and learning

## Resource Requirements

**Per Agent**:
- Training time: ~70 seconds
- Questions: 10,000
- Memory: <1GB during training
- Storage: ~10MB for results

**Total Village**:
- 3 specialized agents
- <30MB total storage
- Minimal runtime memory

## Success Metrics

**Individual Agent Success**:
- Specialization score > 0.80
- At least 3 capabilities at MASTERY level
- Stable performance across all levels

**Village Success**:
- Successful inter-agent communication
- Complementary capability coverage
- Effective task distribution
- Measurable improvement in complex tasks

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Resource Constraints**: Use memory-efficient pipeline proven with Magi
2. **Integration Complexity**: Start with simple message passing
3. **Capability Overlap**: Design distinct specialization profiles
4. **Coordination Overhead**: Implement lightweight protocols

## Next Immediate Steps

1. **Option A**: Create King Agent Now
   ```bash
   python memory_constrained_magi.py --agent-type king
   ```

2. **Option B**: Test Multi-Agent Communication
   ```bash
   python test_agent_communication.py --agents magi
   ```

3. **Option C**: Prepare Sage Training Data
   ```bash
   python prepare_sage_curriculum.py
   ```

## Long-term Vision

The AI Village will eventually include:
- **Magi**: Technical implementation expert
- **King**: Strategic coordinator and decision maker
- **Sage**: Knowledge curator and researcher
- **Guardian**: Security and safety monitor (future)
- **Scout**: Exploration and discovery agent (future)
- **Healer**: System maintenance and optimization (future)

Each agent brings unique capabilities, creating a synergistic collective intelligence greater than the sum of its parts.
