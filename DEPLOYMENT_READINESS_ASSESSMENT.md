2. **BLOCKING:** 6 syntax errors prevent complete security analysis
3. **UNACCEPTABLE:** Security score of 0/100 far below required 70/100
4. **RISK ASSESSMENT:** High probability of security incidents in production

### Required Actions Before Deployment Consideration:
1. ‚úÖ **MANDATORY:** Fix all 6 syntax errors in security files
2. ‚úÖ **MANDATORY:** Resolve all 16 high-severity security vulnerabilities  
3. ‚úÖ **MANDATORY:** Achieve security score ‚â•70/100
4. ‚úÖ **MANDATORY:** Complete clean security scan with zero critical issues
5. ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED:** Review and commit clean test file state
6. ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED:** Achieve overall quality score ‚â•80/100

### Timeline for Resolution:
