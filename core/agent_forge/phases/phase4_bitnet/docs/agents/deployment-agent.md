## Deployment Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- **Blue Environment**: Current production
- **Green Environment**: New version staging
- **Switch Strategy**: Atomic traffic redirection
- **Rollback**: Immediate traffic reversion

### Canary Deployment
- **Initial Release**: 5% traffic to new version
- **Progressive Rollout**: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100%
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous performance assessment
- **Automated Rollback**: Based on error rate thresholds

### Rolling Deployment
- **Instance Replacement**: Gradual instance updates
- **Health Checks**: Per-instance validation
- **Load Balancer Integration**: Traffic management
- **Rollback Strategy**: Previous version restoration
