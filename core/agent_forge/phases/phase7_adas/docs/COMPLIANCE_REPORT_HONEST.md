‚ùå **Production-grade reliability** (prototype stability only)
‚ùå **Safety certification** (no certification process initiated)
‚ùå **Vehicle integration** (simulation and testing only)
‚ùå **Regulatory compliance** (not suitable for compliance submission)

### What Was Theater (Now Eliminated)
üé≠ ~~ISO 26262 compliance~~ - No certification process
üé≠ ~~ASIL-D rating~~ - No safety assessment conducted
üé≠ ~~Production deployment~~ - Research prototype only
üé≠ ~~Type approval~~ - No regulatory submissions
üé≠ ~~96.8% compliance score~~ - No actual compliance measurement

## Safety Assessment (Honest)

### Current Safety Status
- **Safety Requirements**: Educational content only, not validated
- **Hazard Analysis**: Basic research-level analysis, not certified
- **Risk Assessment**: Development-level assessment, not regulatory
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Experimental implementations only
- **Failure Analysis**: Prototype testing, not safety-certified

### Safety Gaps for Production Use
1. **No Formal Safety Analysis** - HAZOP, FMEA, FTA not completed to automotive standards
2. **No Safety Validation** - Testing not to ISO 26262 requirements
3. **No Independent Assessment** - No third-party safety validation
4. **No Certification Process** - Safety lifecycle not initiated
5. **No Production Controls** - Development environment only

## Testing Status (Reality)

### Development Testing Completed
- **Unit Tests**: 65% coverage (development quality)
- **Integration Tests**: Basic connectivity testing
- **Performance Tests**: Honest latency and throughput measurement
- **Robustness Tests**: Limited edge case testing
- **Security Tests**: Basic security practices, not certified

### Production Testing Not Started
‚ùå **Safety Validation Testing** - Requires certified test environment
‚ùå **Regulatory Compliance Testing** - Requires formal certification process
‚ùå **Field Testing** - Not suitable for vehicle deployment
‚ùå **Reliability Testing** - No MTBF/MTTR validation for production
