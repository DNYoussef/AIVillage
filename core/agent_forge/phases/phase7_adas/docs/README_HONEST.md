## Actual Implementation Status

### Development Stage
- **Research Prototype**: Not certified for safety-critical applications
- **No Safety Certification**: Not validated against ISO 26262 or other safety standards
- **Development Stage**: Experimental implementation for research purposes
- **Not Production Ready**: Requires extensive development and validation for real use

### Realistic Technical Capabilities
- **Actual Latency**: 50-200ms on development hardware (varies by model complexity)
- **Research Quality**: Prototype stability for development and testing
- **Basic Sensor Processing**: Computer vision algorithms with simulation capabilities
- **Model Architecture**: Neural network experimentation framework

### Current Features (Honest Assessment)
- **Phase 6 Integration**: Experimental integration with previous development phases
- **Development Platform**: Designed for research and prototyping
- **Basic Framework**: Foundation for future automotive system development
- **Update Mechanism**: Standard software deployment for development environments

## Reality Check - Performance Gaps

The original documentation contained significant performance theater:

### Latency Claims vs Reality
- **Claimed**: 10-30ms end-to-end processing
- **Actual**: 50-200ms on typical hardware
- **Gap Factor**: 5-20x slower than claimed

### Throughput Claims vs Reality
- **Claimed**: 60 FPS real-time processing
- **Actual**: 5-15 FPS on edge devices
- **Gap Factor**: 4-12x slower than claimed

### Compliance Claims vs Reality
- **Claimed**: 96.8% ISO 26262 compliance, ASIL-D certified
- **Actual**: Research prototype with no certification
- **Status**: Not validated for safety-critical use

## What Actually Works

### Implemented Components
- Basic object detection using YOLO/SSD models
- Simple sensor fusion framework
- Prototype safety monitoring
- Basic performance benchmarking tools
- Theater detection and reality validation

### Performance Measurements (Real)
- Object detection: 80-150ms latency on Jetson Xavier
- Sensor processing: 30-50ms per frame
- Planning algorithms: 20-100ms depending on complexity
- Memory usage: 2-8GB depending on model size

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Reality Alignment (Current)
- Remove all performance theater from documentation
- Implement honest performance measurement
- Validate actual vs claimed capabilities
- Update documentation to reflect prototype status

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Improve actual performance through optimization
- Implement missing safety features
- Add comprehensive testing framework
- Document realistic performance targets

### Phase 3: Production Preparation
- Begin safety certification process
- Implement production-grade monitoring
- Add comprehensive validation testing
- Prepare for regulatory compliance
