# MAGI Reasoning Techniques

## Overview

MAGI employs a diverse set of reasoning techniques to tackle complex problems. Each technique has its own strengths and is selected based on task characteristics and requirements. The techniques work together through a sophisticated orchestration system that can combine their capabilities for optimal results.

Steps:
1. Start with 5
2. Multiply by 4: 5 * 4 = 20
3. Multiply by 3: 20 * 3 = 60
4. Multiply by 2: 60 * 2 = 120
5. Multiply by 1: 120 * 1 = 120
Output: 120
```
